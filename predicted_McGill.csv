Microwave facility on campus?,"Hi, I spend a lot of time in the campus and I was wondering if there is any microwaving facility available for students. I am new to the campus and past few days I have been living on outside food which is not really sustainable long term. I was thinking of bringing homecooked food but given the weather I think foods will get cold pretty soon, so it would help if I can microwave them in the campus.

Does the McGill Bookstore support ever answer ??,Ive contacted them through email and through their contact form on their website and they never answered. Its been since the first day of classes. Basically I dont have access to a portal for a book I paid for 180 day access. I should still have access to it but I dont have access to the portal anymore on MyCourses since I dropped the class last semester and Im retaking it now.

Seeking several more participants for brain imaging study this semester!,"The Biosignals and Systems Analysis Lab at McGill is currently seeking healthy individuals, aged 1835, to participate in our ongoing study on interactions between brain imaging and physiology. Our principal investigator is Prof. Georgios D. Mitsis and we have received ethics approval from McGill for this study. If youre interested in helping us, heres some more information

What does participation entail?  
You would participate in between 13 scanning sessions, each lasting 12 hours, for which you would be compensated at the rate of approximately 25hr. The first is held at the McConnell Engineering building, on campus and is a screening session for the rest of the study. The second and third sessions are held at the Montreal General Hospital and include MRI scans.

Who can participate?  
Prospective participants must meet the following criteria

 Aged 1835
 No underlying medical conditions 
 Not claustrophobic 
 Not pregnant 
 No metallic fragments or implants in your body 
 If you have piercings or transdermal patches, you must be able to remove them during scans
 Head circumference no larger than 57 cm

How do I know my head size?  
If you think your head size is slightly smaller than the average person, you are likely a good candidate for this study. This has nothing to do with your brain function, by the way  its purely so that you are comfortably able to fit some of our equipment for scans! We will also email you a guide to measuring your head size at home so you can doublecheck before our first session.

How do I get started or find out more?  
You can direct message this account to receive our email address for further communication. You can also find this email address directly in the poster for our study in the attached image. Feel free to circulate this poster to others whom you think may be interested, as well!

Will I get to see what my brain looks like?  
Participants who continue past the initial screening session the majority of participants do! will receive MRI scans during the subsequent sessions. We will be more than happy to show you what your brain looks like 

Study flyer send us an email to get started!httpspreview.redd.itjm4zwwo1vlee1.jpg?width720formatpjpgautowebpsb6d722d1ed4e86e353303c1883a2a6652cd4e1ec

Thinking of transferring from mechanical engineering to math,"Hi, Im a second year mech eng student. Im taking this semester off because I felt I was getting close to burnout after final season.

In terms of career, Im not sure what you can do after having a math major I thought of quant finance? and I assume that mechanical engineering would open more doors but I dont really see myself doing engineer work, I dont build stuff.

HIST 298 Topics in History ,"Im having like confusing issues about a teacher at Mcgill. First off, the teacher doesnt really teach at all. She pretty much just talks about herself and books that she suggests, but doesnt speak on the topic Caribbean History at all. She just doesnt give any content, just talks about nonrelated matter. Its our fifth class, and Ive taken approximately 12 lines of notes. 

Second, as I assume well have to learn from readings, she assigns over 500 pages of readings weekly, which is simply not doable. Theres about 12 tests 2 primary source analysis which she gave no information whatsoever, 5 essays on unknown topics, 2 map quiz which she doesnt post online, just blank maps with numbers 

What should I do? I already have a feeling that itll be difficult to hold a good grade in this class, given her rather lack of teaching whatsoever. All she does all class in answer questions for 5 minutes without any real clear information and questions are relating her lack of information, that I think everyone is clearly hella confused about Should I make a complaint?

Exchange course equivalency with different credit systems?,"Hi folks.

  
I wanna go on exchange in the fall and Im getting increasingly perplexed by the credit systems other schools use. For example, at the University of Edinburgh, in order to get 30 Ects 15 credits my options are 3 x 10ect courses. This means each course is roughly 5 credits back at McGill. What will that look like on my transcript though? Will it say I took 15 credits good or only 3 classes bad ?

  
Basically I guess I just wanna know if the actual credit count matters more or if the specific course completion matters more. If anyone else has been in this situation and has any insight please let me know!

Kinesiology U2 review,"This is to follow up a post I did last year about kinesiology U1. The following courses below are ones you would typically take in your U2 year.

In the fall I took, EDKP 292, EDKP 396, EDKP 395, and EDKP 443. In the winter, I took EDKP 350, EDKP 449, EDKP 448



EDKP 292 Nutrition and Wellness

I found the lectures to be interesting. There were 2 different instructors and both were engaging. There were 10 quizzes so it was about 1 a week. If you do the reading before these quizzes are easy. There was also 3 different case studies, the first 2 were worth 30 each and the last was worth 10. They did give lots of hints during class about what would be on these case studies and would walk through examples. There was also an assignment worth 20 on a supplement. He gives a very detailed outline of what he expects and what you get marks for which made this assignment very easy.

  
EDKP 396 Adapted Physical Activity

This class was interesting, but I know some people in the Kin program really hate. You work one on one with someone with a disability. The assignments require a bit amount of work and you need to use lecture content to complete them. For attendance for PTC, you need to show up or have a doctors note  to still get 100. If youre sick and dont attend hell dock you for attendance. Overall, I enjoyed it but its definitely not everyone. The final was okay, all multiple choice so there were some very specific questions that I just guessed.

  
EDKP 395 Exercise Physiology

I really enjoyed this class. Char makes it super easy to do well and tells you exactly what to expectwhat she is looking for. Midterm and final she gave us hints of what the exercise scenario would be which helped a lot. Sometimes its a bit tricky to wrap your head around because there is so much going on, but I just spent time going over material and going to office hours. She really values creativity in the journal club presentations. 

  
EDKP 443 Research methods

This was a hard class because of the grading. Its pretty dry material because its just going over research methods. Instructor has changed since I took it so not sure how it is now. 

  
EDKP 449 Neuromuscular and Inflammatory Pathophys

Interesting class overall. Both the midterm and final were online which was nice. One group project where you have to write a paper and do a presentation. Overall chill. Benoit was hard to understand at times, but nothing too surprising. Definitely one of the easier complementries to take to fulfill the advanced exercise physiology requirement.

  
EDKP 448 Exercise and Health Psychology

Theres only a midterm in this class and not that much material. I didnt find it too bad. Our year had to do podcasts which I found horrible because they gave us not that much time to talk about a lot of stuff. Couple group projects which werent bad. Definitely an easier course. you dont really have to go to class after the midterm tbh

  
EDKP 350 Celena class

Honestly fun class. typical celena class. It is a bit much because you have labs due every week and also have to prep for the lab that day because there is a quiz. Overall, pretty easy to do well, just a bit stressful because there is a practical exam at the end where you randomly draw which test you have to do.

Full text of the open letter from floor fellows last year.,"Deputy Provost Labeau, 

We are writing to urge the reversal of the planned decision to abolish the Floor Fellow position in McGill student housing for the 20242025 academic year.  This decision, which removes a longstanding and fundamental pillar of McGills residence system, is another step in McGills overall decline as an institution revered globally as a paragon of academic excellence. This decision, taken without due and open consultation with the McGill community, leaves McGill as the only major Canadian university, and one of the few in North America, without a Floor Fellow, Residence Assistant, or other comparable livein student support position. More importantly, this leaves firstyear students, many of whom are minors leaving their homes and families for the first time, without the readily accessible and flexible peer support that is critical for their continued safety and academic success. 

It is blatantly untrue to argue that the Floor Fellow position can be replaced or is made redundant by the already existing student support systems at McGill, such as the Wellness Hub, the Office of the Dean of Students, or the Office for Sexual Violence Response, Support and Education.  These resources, which the Floor Fellows all know well and work closely with, do not address the crucial niche that the Floor Fellow position was created to fill.  

AskMcGill describes Floor Fellows as upperyear livein student staff members, trained in firstaid and crisis intervention, tasked with rolemodelling, community building and peer counseling, while the recently deleted page on the SHHS website states that Ultimately, the floor fellows are amazing resources for an abundant amount of diverse information, are capable of providing much of the needed support for incoming students, and are continually striving to build a community in which each and every student feels respected.

It is because we live in residence alongside the students under our charge that students see us as a trusted peer they can rely on for support.  This cohabitation model, adopted by over 90 of Canadian Universities, creates a sense of community that engenders trust and creates a space where students are not afraid to report situations theyd otherwise be uncomfortable or unwilling to disclose. 

Unlike the staff at OSVRSE, The Wellness Hub, or the Office of the Dean of Students, the Floor Fellows are not professional counsellors, doctors, EMTs, or mediators.  Our role is not to provide professional aid, but to offer flexible, accessible, personalised support, intimately tailored to the needs of the individual residents under our care. Unlike the staff at other McGill support offices, Floor Fellows are livein peer support, who are trained, accountable, and best positioned to respond to a huge variety of situations that can occur, often with little to no warning, during the times when other services are closed, unavailable, fullybooked, or inaccessible due to lack of awareness or difficulty navigating the booking process.  

Given that Floor Fellows live with the students we support, we build close and flexible relationships with residents, beyond what is possible with nonlive in support staff, or full time managerial staff, such as Residence Life Managers, who are not peers.  Through this social and physical proximity, Floor Fellows are able to identify problems as they arise, and take proactive, rather than reactive, steps to offer support.  Removing Floor Fellows from residences will mean that the other support offices, already overburdened, are left reacting to situations only when they reach crisis level, rather than offering proactive intervention and support beforehand.

The firstyear student population in student housing has and will continue to be mostly composed of teenagers who have never lived outside of their family home. Floor Fellows are a bridge between the familial structure and adult independence. Over the course of their first year, a Floor Fellow will often help first year students learn how to identify challenges and build selfadvocacy skills. 

It is often Floor Fellows, not staff from OSVRSE, the Wellness hub, or virtual therapists, who are first on the scene to medical emergencies, suicide attempts, violations of safety and dignity, harassment, and disclosures of sexual violence that occur in residence. Floor Fellows respond to these situations instantly and flexibly, because of the proximity, both social and physical, to the residents we support.   It is Floor Fellows who respond after hours, Floor Fellows who proactively identify concerns before they emerge into acute crisis, and Floor Fellows who provide referrals to the professional services that can best support our residents in a given situation.   Floor Fellows often make the difference between life and death in emergency situations, as you will read in many of the pieces of testimony attached at the end of this letter. 

The Wellness Hub, already a target of widespread criticism, is not adequate to replace the longterm close support peer support offered by the Floor Fellows role.  The 202324 Residence Handbook describes the Hub as offering shortterm, episodic care for students experiencing common mental and physical health concerns.  In contrast, Floor Fellows, as livein staff, see and speak to their residents regularly and offer peer support and aid on a constant basis.

The newly created Residence Life Senior Advisor though advertised as a mental health support position, does not require any professional certification training in mental health, and, once again, is not replacing the livein peer support and crisis intervention role of the Floor Fellows.  

Additional protection patrollers, who are not peers, not always available, and do not work during the day, cannot replace the services of livein Floor Fellows, who support students both during moments of acute crisis, and through the casual everyday difficulties of adjusting to university life.  When a student is experiencing an acute crisis after hours, they are much more likely to reach out to a Floor Fellow, who is a familiar face with an established relationship, than a protection patroller who may be a stranger to them.

Virtual services like telehealth, Maple, and keep.meSAFE do not replace the personalised support from a known trusted, trained, and accountable Floor Fellow. In the business of mental health, it is availability, flexibility, personalization, and warmth that makes the difference.  A faceless voice from the other side of a phone or computer screen is not an acceptable replacement for the proactive and personal care that Floor Fellows provide.  

The Local Wellness Advisor in residence, while an indispensable resource, is simply not able to offer adequate support to over 3000 students.  At the time of writing, the Local Wellness Advisor in residence, Margot Nossal, has no online availability to book a oneonone support session for any time within the remainder of the academic year.  Floor Fellows, who work closely with the LWA in residence, offer the crucial service of bridging the gap between residents and the LWA by filing care reports and referrals, providing insight to LWAs about the urgency and severity of cases, and offering support and advice when students are not able to access other supports. Without Floor Fellows, the LWA will struggle to identify the residents who need their support, leading to increased mental health problems and acute crises.

The Office for Sexual Violence Response, Support and Education does not have a mandate to handle disclosures and provide appropriate support in the immediate aftermath of sexual violence. In one highly publicised example, a McGill student waited three weeks to receive support from OSVRSE after an incidence of sexual violence.  While Floor Fellows do not provide the same kinds of support as the professionals within OSVRSE, the service provided by Floor Fellows to students in crisis in the aftermath of sexual violence has been pivotal.  The simple presence of a trusted, trained, and accountable figure who can help direct students in crisis to OSVRSE and help them navigate this foreign institution at a vulnerable time can be and has been invaluable  this is the support Floor Fellows provide. 

Suicidal ideation, a situation Floor Fellows are specifically trained to respond to, is nearly impossible to detect without a support system capable of identifying and responding to abnormal behavior from students. The University of Toronto recently made national news after three students ended their own lives within two years. In 2019, a student ended their own life in Waterloo residences. These tragedies underscore the importance of a peer support system in McGill residences.  A national survey of Canadian university students reported that 95 of students reported being overwhelmed, 84 suffered from anxiety, and 80 were lonely or depressed.

When asked about the impacts of abolishing the Floor Fellow position, Dr. Norman Hoffman, a clinical psychiatrist and former director the McGill mental health program, was direct increased number of dropouts of students with emotional problems, increased suicide rate, and increased number of suicides of students after they drop out

Ria Rombough, Associate Director of Residence Life from 20142017, echoed this sentiment  The phrase that everybody says is people are going to die, students are going to die  I know of and have witnessed many situations where a floor fellows was directly responsible for saving a life, and knowing the circumstances as I do, theres nothing and no one else who would have saved that person

Other student support services do not fulfil the role of Floor Fellows.  The decision to abolish Floor Fellows will result in death.

In the face of tuition increases, declining applications, and declining institutional prestige, McGill University looks ahead to an uncertain future.  For decades, the Floor Fellow role has been an integral part of the student experience at McGill.  The overwhelming support for and impact of this role is reflected in the testimony at the bottom of this letter.  In the face of an uncertain future, the rash decision to abolish the Floor Fellows, taken without any open consultation, transparency, or due consideration, will, if carried out, be another mark of McGills institutional decline.  

Provost Lebeau, it is not too late to overturn this decision.  The Floor Fellows have been made aware that the abolition of the position was not financially motivated, and that Student Housing has refused to transparently release the results of their internal strategic review.   Particularly in light of this, we urge you to come to the table, to work with McGills Floor Fellows.   

The Floor Fellows, for decades, have been clear that the wellbeing of our residents, and McGill Residence Life as an institution is our priority.  We want to be best equipped to support our residents, and have always fought for this priority alongside our own collective interests as workers.  

The Floor Fellows have made clear that we are willing to come to the table.  The Office of Student Life and Learning advertises its managerial philosophy as Missiondriven, dependable, collaborative, transparent, proactive.  Now is the time to put your words into action. Residents in McGill student housing deserve an environment that supports their safety and wellbeing, and enables them to thrive. 

Floor Fellows save lives.  We hope that you recognize this fact before it is too late.

Disability and accessibility at McGill ,"I have this daunting feeling that McGill is not as diverse and inclusive and caring as they claim to be. At all. 

As someone who was diagnosed with ASD, ADHD and loads of other mental health problems along with physical disabilities and I use mobility aids I have kind of experienced all the aspects of McGills accessibility efforts. Im in my second year here doing U1 pharmacology and I was in rez last year. 

So firstly its the SAA, student accessibility and achievements. Basically they are really good at offering you things like alternative test environments and stop watch, but thats it. They have this lazy misunderstanding of disability and thinks that this will solve all the problems. This is not accessibility. This is ADHD exam accessibility only. 

Im sharing some of my experiences with SAA below. 

So I am supposed to get noise cancelling headphones for my exams but I never did. The alternative environment is actually more overheated and crowded with wobbly tables and people chewing on their snacks loud than the field house. That said, at least SAA was generous about offering these accommodations. But then when it comes to extensions for deadlines and other academic work that are not examsthey just leave you to confront the profs alone. For me I dont have enough energy to talk to profs individually for each assignment, and SAA doesnt care if I need help with that. 

Then its the huge lack of physical accessibility. You will have to ASK them and URGE them for any accommodations. And oh the confusion in the advisors eyes! Its like they dont know what to do for you anymore because theyve never done anything like that. You have a neuromuscular condition and you cant write properly? Well what about extensions on exams? And thats it. Same old stuff. But how am I supposed to get to the exam room when I have this condition? They dont know. Well they offered on campus transportation but its only for the main roads and from one main building to another, and youll have to schedule it in advance. What if I have more than one class a day in more than one building? With ten minutes break in between even? They dont know. They go back to note taking apps. 

Alright. Then its the wellness hub. The one that never has any doctors. And since Im international I have Maple. The one with only one doctor available and the doctor told me to stop my medication from maximum dose to zero overnight, and denied saying that afterwards when I fainted in the ER and hit my head causing a concussion. Well done doctors. I just love how McGill tortures us academically and takes away the safety net as well. 

So Im posting this to start conversations about McGills accessibility, and with the intention of potentially starting a student advocacy group for improving the situation. McGill is doing us wrong or at least not enough, and wether we actively do something to change it a little bit or we just share our experiences here, I hope it will make you feel less alone. We deserve more than this.

"Without Floor Fellows, First Years are Falling Through the Cracks","A student died yesterday. I dont know them, nor how it happened, but it happened. It would be disrespectful to the dead to speculate on what happened, but I think these two events speak to a larger issue within McGill student residences. As many of you are aware, McGill announced last year the decision to eliminate Floor Fellows in favour of socalled Residence Life Managers RLMs. I was not a student at the time, but I know this decision was widely criticized for its potential to deprive first years of essential resources that could help them in a crisis. As far as I am aware, however, these debates have since died down. I feel that these tragic events are reason enough to finally reopen the discussion.

As a first year student, I have long been frustrated with the way support for first years is provided. To be blunt, RLMs are useless. As individuals, I am sure that they are caring people who want to do whatever they can to support first years, and so I do not wish to indict anybody individually here, they are not at fault. However, as an institution they are completely ineffective. I have maybe seen my RLMs once or twice throughout the year, and that was during frosh when they essentially were just there to herd us like preschoolers into Tomlinson Fieldhouse for us to play some orientation games. I have not seen them since. Barely involved in social media activities or even to try and visibly organize events beyond the occasional poster, I dont believe anybody I know knows who their RLMs are or where to see them. They stand aloof from us and yet were supposed to turn to them for support in a crisis.

This brings me to my next issue their complete inaccessibility. The whole point of having a Floor Fellow or an RA in general is to have someone who is readily accessible for support whenever students need them. The fact that they are only accessible via office hours, which for the record are barely advertised, is frankly nonsensical. If I or someone else, struggling with the burdens of first year and, for many, the first time being away from home, is feeling suicidal, what we need is immediate support from someone that can be trusted. Instead, what we get is needing to navigate a confusing bureaucracy only to have the only support available be someone that is effectively a stranger in an office who will meet you at 300 PM on a Tuesday in two weeks. Because it makes sense for the suicidal ideations of an isolated first year to be treated as equivalent to a mundane question about the syllabus. And what about students with preexisting or emerging health issues? The bureaucracy of both the Student Wellness Hub and the Quebec healthcare system for someone not from Quebec would be enough to make Kafka blush. What is there for students who need help navigating this system or require easily accessible support?

I am thankful to be surrounded by supportive friends and people who would be there for me if ever a crisis arose. But many do not have this luxury. Many first year students have few or even no friends at McGill. This may be the first time theyve ever left home. They may not be confident in their English or in French, resulting in further feelings of alienation at McGill. This may be their first time exposed to alcohol or drugs, and it being possibly their only way of finally feeling accepted in their new home, they may push themselves far beyond their limits. And the only people there to help them if that happens are a bunch of severely drunk freshman who probably could not give less of a shit about their wellbeing.

To die, just as one is entering the world, with hopes and dreams for what your life could be that will never be realized, is tragic. I dont know this person, and I will reiterate that I will not speculate on how they died out of respect for themselves, their friends, and their family. Maybe having Floor Fellows could not have prevented these things from happening. Regardless of the circumstances, may they rest in peace, and I hope those closest to them may find peace and healing. Nonetheless, these events are concerning in light of the overarching fact that first years are falling through the cracks at McGill, not by accident or by lack of funding, but by a conscious decision to eliminate a vital service to provide immediate support for vulnerable first years. And I think the most damning fact about all of this is that all that the university could provide in light of yesterdays events for students possibly now dealing with the trauma of witnessing what had transpired were a singular Resident Life Manager only accessible from the hours of 10 to 4 and a link to a help line.

I believe it is necessary to petition the university to make change, to reinstitute Floor Fellows and to offer further support and resources for students that could actually make a difference in their lives, rather than placing them in the hands of distant administrators. As an individual, I cannot do much, and I am unfamiliar with how to petition the university or the SSMU. But I cant stand around and say nothing. McGill, in their efforts to cut corners, has put the lives of countless first years at risk. This cannot continue.

I was informed that this death was the result of a sudden medical emergency and couldnt have been prevented.

Bad or good idea adding BIOL 305 to my schedule?,"EDIT I ended up not taking it so the question is solved.

Is It Possible to Get an Engineering Internship with a very low GPA 2.0?,"I would say that I entered university out of obligation rather than out of passion. Therefore, Ive not been taking University as seriously as I should have, until I nearly got kicked out because of my bad grades recently.

Getting an internship would ideally be my first step, but I dont know how likely it is to get an internship with 2.0 GPA as a thirdyear student. The last time I worked was 3 years ago in a warehouse as a labourer for a summer. Although I have worked as a sports staff for teenagers 247 for 6 weeks, when I was also a teenager.

I have a friend group of close friends but not to the point of where Id live with them. What do I do next year?,"Its not really that I dont want to live with them, but we all have different situations some are going to live with siblings next year, etc etc. Im starting to get stressed because it seems like everyone is confirming who theyre going to live with next year and although I have a friend group and even a best friend at McGill I just dont see myself living with any of them. But I also do feel like its uncommon to live alone, unless you live in downtown.

What should I do? Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is getting an apartment alone a good move? I know some people find roommates online but I dont really want to do that because a. I dont know the person and b. My parents wouldnt allow it.

A lot of my friends at McGill have apartments alone but I just dont see myself living alone. I know its great to have your own space but I feel like part of the uni experience is to live with others. I also tend to selfisolate if Im alone so I know living with others is going to be so much better for me, but I just dont know who to live with. Its all very complicated.

Theres still 4 months left in the year and I could meet other people that who knows, I might end up living with but as of now it seems very uncertain and unstable.

Transferring out of McGill...,"Hey guys! Im in U0 science in the BBL group. I initially came to McGill because it was my dream school, I wanted to go into medical school, I wanted to get away from my family, I liked the city life here, and I wanted to practice my French.

But recently Ive been rethinking my decision to go into medical school. The workload, mostly memorization, and many years of working and schooling just isnt appealing for me. I love doing research and being handson, and still want to work in the medical field, its just that I would much rather spend my hours in a lab designing stuff than memorizing names of diseases.

Im very interested in biomedical engineering, however I know that McGills biomedical engineering minor is only open to engineering students. Ive been looking into UBCs biomedical engineering major, which is closer to home, but Im still unsure if I should transfer. One, I honestly do enjoy it here. Im in clubs, Im doing research, and I like my classes and professors, even if I have no friends and am pretty lonely. Two, if I end up applying for medical school, I worry if my CGPA from a BME program would be lower than what Im currently pursuing, anatomy  cell biology. This is also why Im not really considering transferring to the Faculty of Engineering also I dont meet the prereqs.

Thing is, I have heard that those who go into the BME field rarely find jobs if they dont have an engineering undergraduate degree. If I end up not going to medical school, I plan on pursuing a Masters and PhD in BME, but if I dont switch my program, Id have to learn a lot of the courses like calculus, coding, and physics myself, which may not be as efficient.

I have tentatively decided to continue with my anat  cell bio major, as this might help with designing medical devices in BME and I do enjoy learning the content, and plan to take a few BME electives. However, I really dont want to regret not transferring as I do want to work in the healthcare field, not just as a cell biologist or something.

Sorry for the confusing read, Ive been pretty stressed out over this recently! Id really appreciate any tips or maybe even potential career paths for me. Before this the only option Ive considered is becoming a surgeon so Im still researching about the different options available to me.",1736555704,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1hyjlzm/transferring_out_of_mcgill/,17,Whole_Tea_2830,1hyjlzm,1/11/2025 0:35,"['hey', 'guys!', 'im', 'u', 'science', 'bbl', 'group.', 'initially', 'came', 'mcgill', 'dream', 'school', 'wanted', 'go', 'medical', 'school', 'wanted', 'get', 'away', 'family', 'liked', 'city', 'life', 'wanted', 'practice', 'french.', 'recently', 'ive', 'rethinking', 'decision', 'go', 'medical', 'school.', 'workload', 'mostly', 'memorization', 'many', 'years', 'working', 'schooling', 'isnt', 'appealing', 'me.', 'love', 'research', 'handson', 'still', 'want', 'work', 'medical', 'field', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'spend', 'hours', 'lab', 'designing', 'stuff', 'memorizing', 'names', 'diseases.', 'im', 'interested', 'biomedical', 'engineering', 'however', 'know', 'mcgills', 'biomedical', 'engineering', 'minor', 'open', 'engineering', 'students.', 'ive', 'looking', 'ubcs', 'biomedical', 'engineering', 'major', 'closer', 'home', 'im', 'still', 'unsure', 'transfer.', 'one', 'honestly', 'enjoy', 'here.', 'im', 'clubs', 'im', 'research', 'like', 'classes', 'professors', 'even', 'friends', 'pretty', 'lonely.', 'two', 'end', 'applying', 'medical', 'school', 'worry', 'cgpa', 'bme', 'program', 'would', 'lower', 'im', 'currently', 'pursuing', 'anatomy', 'cell', 'biology.', 'also', 'im', 'really', 'considering', 'transferring', 'faculty', 'engineering', 'also', 'dont', 'meet', 'prereqs.', 'thing', 'heard', 'go', 'bme', 'field', 'rarely', 'find', 'jobs', 'dont', 'engineering', 'undergraduate', 'degree.', 'end', 'going', 'medical', 'school', 'plan', 'pursuing', 'masters', 'phd', 'bme', 'dont', 'switch', 'program', 'id', 'learn', 'lot', 'courses', 'like', 'calculus', 'coding', 'physics', 'may', 'efficient.', 'tentatively', 'decided', 'continue', 'anat', 'cell', 'bio', 'major', 'might', 'help', 'designing', 'medical', 'devices', 'bme', 'enjoy', 'learning', 'content', 'plan', 'take', 'bme', 'electives.', 'however', 'really', 'dont', 'want', 'regret', 'transferring', 'want', 'work', 'healthcare', 'field', 'cell', 'biologist', 'something.', 'sorry', 'confusing', 'read', 'ive', 'pretty', 'stressed', 'recently!', 'id', 'really', 'appreciate', 'tips', 'maybe', 'even', 'potential', 'career', 'paths', 'me.', 'option', 'ive', 'considered', 'becoming', 'surgeon', 'im', 'still', 'researching', 'different', 'options', 'available', 'me.']",1,0,0,0

Desautels transfers and math GPA,"Hihi all,

I hope the backtoschool season isnt too tough on anyone here. Im majoring in Economics and hope to transfer to Desautels for Commerce next year. According to their interfaculty transfer page, there are several mathrelated requirements for transferring to BComm, including maintaining a minimum math CGPA of 3.3.

Last semesterI took MATH133, but unfortunately, I superbombed the final, which left me with a C in the course super annoying. What do I need to do to improve my math CGPA? Does anyone have recommendations for classes I could take? If I retake MATH133, will it overwrite my previous grade, or will they average the two?

Additionally, the application requires a motivation letter. Im fortunate to have strong extracurriculars tied to what I want to do at Desautels, including parttime accounting positions and running my own business. Will these help strengthen my application?

I create a free tool that automate Minerva course registration,"Hey everyone,

We all know how stressful Minerva can be during adddroprefreshing constantly, typing CRNs over and over, and still missing spots. Ive tried some tools out there, but they didnt work for me or didnt support waitlists, so I decided to make my own!

Its a super simple Chrome extension that automates course registration. Its free, opensource, and runs locally on your device no data collection. It just handles the repetitive stuff for you.

How it works

1. Log into Minerva, go to the quick adddrop page, and select the semester.
2. Click the extension icon.
3. Enter your CRNs one per line and set the check interval.
4. Hit Start AutoRegistration.

The extension will keep trying to register your courses based on the frequency you set. Youll need to keep the Minerva tab and the extension open for it to work.

 Important Note  
The tool mimics human interaction, but to avoid any issues with IT, use a cautious check frequency e.g., every 30 minutes or longer. Setting it too fast could raise flags.

You can grab it here

Regrets on choices taken during degree ,"hello, as I am graduating this semester and thinking about my future, I am feeling a real sense of dread due to some choices I made throughout my degree.

I will be graduating with a BA in psychology and minor in communications, and planning on pursuing a masters in Europe UKFrance. I dropped my behavioural science minor in second year because I knew I didnt want to go into clinical psychology, and stuck with my communications minor. I wanted to take a wider range of classes also in my other interests, while taking only the pysc classes that interested me. I had the opportunity to apply to the management minor which I would have completed in my third year, but unfortunately I let myself get influenced and scared I wasnt going to be able to complete it, or it was going to be bad for my GPAstress.

Now I am feeling like my degree is useless or not good enough because I have only one minor. I have a good gpa however, and 2 months of marketing internship 2 separate months plus a few extracuriculars in communications for societies.

I want to apply for masters in marketing, and I am scared my profile is not good enough. I thought I was going to be okay because I care, and I am a hard worker, but now I am not so sure.

I am looking for perspectiveadvice on any of these issues haha, I just feel so much regret over not having applied for that management minor. Most UK masters say they accept people from a wide range of backgrounds and degrees, but I am scared mine is not good enough now. I dont know how I managed to screw up when all I wanted was to do well in school.",1736379542,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1hwyms5/regrets_on_choices_taken_during_degree/,7,SensitiveCaramel8321,1hwyms5,1/8/2025 23:39,"['hello', 'graduating', 'semester', 'thinking', 'future', 'feeling', 'real', 'sense', 'dread', 'due', 'choices', 'made', 'throughout', 'degree.', 'graduating', 'ba', 'psychology', 'minor', 'communications', 'planning', 'pursuing', 'masters', 'europe', 'ukfrance.', 'dropped', 'behavioural', 'science', 'minor', 'second', 'year', 'knew', 'didnt', 'want', 'go', 'clinical', 'psychology', 'stuck', 'communications', 'minor.', 'wanted', 'take', 'wider', 'range', 'classes', 'also', 'interests', 'taking', 'pysc', 'classes', 'interested', 'me.', 'opportunity', 'apply', 'management', 'minor', 'would', 'completed', 'third', 'year', 'unfortunately', 'let', 'get', 'influenced', 'scared', 'wasnt', 'going', 'able', 'complete', 'going', 'bad', 'gpastress.', 'feeling', 'like', 'degree', 'useless', 'good', 'enough', 'one', 'minor.', 'good', 'gpa', 'however', 'months', 'marketing', 'internship', 'separate', 'months', 'plus', 'extracuriculars', 'communications', 'societies.', 'want', 'apply', 'masters', 'marketing', 'scared', 'profile', 'good', 'enough.', 'thought', 'going', 'okay', 'care', 'hard', 'worker', 'sure.', 'looking', 'perspectiveadvice', 'issues', 'haha', 'feel', 'much', 'regret', 'applied', 'management', 'minor.', 'uk', 'masters', 'say', 'accept', 'people', 'wide', 'range', 'backgrounds', 'degrees', 'scared', 'mine', 'good', 'enough', 'now.', 'dont', 'know', 'managed', 'screw', 'wanted', 'well', 'school.']",1,0,0,0

I took Biol 115 first year for my arts freshman requirements. Ive since decided to backtrack and take my full science pre reqs including Biol 111 and 112. I know that they are overlapping courses, meaning I cant receive credit in all three but I am confused about the specifics there. Does this mean I will lose the credits for 115 after I  take 111 and 112?  Or am I unable to take and receive credit in 111 and 112 altogether because I took 115?

also, will my grade for Biol 115 still count towards my GPA is the credits are discounted?

This is how to get a good grade in  PSYC 215,"WITH LYDON Hey everyone so I thought i would be helpful and tell you guys how I got a B in the class I couldve gotten more Ill explain, if I had known about this. So I failed the first exam bad like 46 and I had watched all the lectures but had not gone to class or read the textbook. That got me thinking. How could I not even pass when I watched and studied everything? So I did an experiment. I JUST read the textbook for exam 2. No lecture at all not even one. I didnt go to class at all or had gotten the bonus points which he gives alot of. For the textbook its important you take notes. Im talking term definition and little summaries of the experiments. On my second exam I got 76 and there was maybe 2 questions that were from his lectures. The other reason I lost points was cause well I barely studied my notes. For the final I did the same, just read the textbook for all the material and had I not wasted half the semester on midterm one uselessly watching his lecture I could ended up with an extremely high grade in his class by not going to even one. If you go to class dont pay attention cause ur overfilling ur brain with useless information, just go for the bonus points.

Frustrated with McGill Summer Housing,"Im turning to Reddit because Im honestly so disappointed with McGills administration and housing services. Ive been emailing the housing office and the RVC front desk since October 2024, and all theyve done is redirect me to each other without giving me any real answers. Its just been generic responses telling me to email the other departmentover and over again.

Im an international graduate student, and my program starts May 1st. Ive been trying to figure out the process for summer housing, like
	1.	When do dorms open for summer students?
	2.	How early can I move in?
	3.	Whats the procedure for booking housing?

But instead of clear answers, they keep telling me to email again in March or April to check for availability. Like what the actual f? How do they expect an international student to wait until the last minute to book housing? I cant even book my flights without knowing this info. And I just know the response in April will be something like, Sorry, everythings booked!

Its so frustrating because this kind of delay just feeds into the stereotype that international students are disorganized or entitled when, in reality, were trying to plan ahead. Ive sent multiple emails and waited weeks for useless responses. I get it if I was an inprovince student or a returning student who knows the system, but Im new to the countrythe least they can do is provide clear info.

This whole experience is making me secondguess if McGill is going downhill. Like, Im paying thousands in tuition, and they cant even send a welcome packet or housing guide? Just expecting students to figure it out on their own?

Anyway, if anyone has experience with summer housing at McGill, PLEASE help me out. The website says summer accommodations for the public open May 19th, but what about students whose classes start May 1st?

Transferring from concordia to mc gill,"Hey! Im a freshman this year and ill be going into my second semester. Ive realized biochem is not for me and was thinking to switching to animal health at mc gill. Ive had As and Bs in my classes for the fall semester. 

Does anyone knows how many credits do i have to have in order to be able to switch unis? I know 12 credits are necessary to build a gpa at the end of the year. I dont know if Mc Gill requires a specific amount of credit to have in order to allow transfer. 

Im debating whether or not i should drop my hard core class to not endanger my final gpa, and be a part time student?

Spending too long in uni,"I have been planning out my degree recently and have a dilemma on my hands. I wanted to switch into a program that would potentially extend my time here at McGill by an extra semester from 3.5 years to 4 years.

W2026 MATH 325, MATH 358, MATH 455, MATH 475, COMP 345

Now, Ive heard these are hard but standard semesters, but Im honestly scared. The reason Im so hesitant to extend my stay is because I already spent 4 years in CEGEP and now spending another 4 years in uni... I would be graduating at the age of 24 almost 25 and idk I feel like I should get in the workforce already. So should I extend my stay or would I be able to tough it out?

Should I choose ECON 338 or 437 ?,"Hey, Im a U3 student majoring in economics with a minor in stats and a minor in cog sci. I would like to work in data analysis  science and Im trying to decide between taking econ 338 intro to econometrics 2 or econ 437 methods for causal inference. From what I read, the former delves deeper in the theoretical underpinnings of econometrics by introducing propensity scores, instrumental variables, RCT... while the latter might be less conceptually advanced but has the advantage of being very applied, as it focuses on using STATA to evaluate the impact of public policies. 

For now, Im registered in 338 since the course content seems to include the concepts taught in 437 and actually goes further. Also, 437 is a very recent class and I didnt hear feedback from students who took it already. 

However, I still have doubts and might switch to 437 since it is more applied and seems to give concrete data analysis methods.

For those who may not want to stay in this province for their personal reasons, better job opportunity outside Quebec, not wanting to learn french, etc.

Am I getting kicked out of mcgill? Urgent pls,"TLDR Will I get kicked out because my Fall GPA is 0.00, even though my D1D2 grades wont be finalized until the end of the winter term?

Hi everyone, Im posting on a throwaway account because Im freaking out and need advice.

I just finished my first semester as a first year U1, faculty of arts, and to get straight to the point, heres the situation

I was in a challenging program that Im switching out of next semester. I took 4 courses this term 

	2 electives Ill only need them as prerequisites if I decide to pursue a minor. 

	2 required D1D2 courses for my major. Most of the grade will be determined in the winter term the D2 course, since Im switching out of the other program.

The issue is that Ive failed both electives 

	One grade is already out, and its an F. 

	The other grade hasnt been released yet, but Im certain I failed it too.

The D1D2 courses dont have final grades yet, my fall term GPA is 0.00. Im panicking bc idk if this means Ill get kicked out of McGill or placed on unsatisfactory standing which means i will get kicked out?.

"PHIL 231, PHIL 237, PHIL 240 as electives?","does anybody have any experience in these classes with the following professors

PHIL 231 with William Roberts I heard hes a great professor and his class is very interesting and you learn a lot from it which sounds very intriguing to me, but people also say hes very tough on essay grading and Im afraid that might cost me an A I need good GPA for med school. Im not confident in my essaywriting skills tbh and as much as I would love to improve them in a course where the professor gives good feedback, I dont know if its worth risking my grade for it. Is it as bad as people say it is? Would you still recommend?

  
PHIL 237 with Keven Bisson This sounds like a super interesting course but I havent been able to find any reviews on this professor. Has anyone ever taken any of their classes? What are they like?

  


PHIL 240 with Oron Magal Generally positive reviews on the prof but not many on the course itself. If you have any experience taking this class please do share!



I am considering one of these as an elective alongside phys, chem,  math so I dont want anything that would make my semester workload unbearable or impact my performance in those courses Iykwim ! 

thanks to anybody who shares their experience

BIOC220320,"Hey Guys! I know many in biochemistry will start bioc220 next semester good luck with that! so I wanted to give a few advice to those that may be on reddit. No one told me back then what it would be like and as I just finished bioc320, I think I can offer some guidance. I know its a tough course, be ready that it takes over almost all of your time. Bioc220 is bad, 320 is worse. 

Bioc220 is basically a lab course but harder its nothing like the organic chemistry labs. The Monday lecture gives you some info on the lab of the week, you read the lab manual in advance, make a flow sheet, show up to your 6h lab, do a quiz on the lab content and then do the actual lab. But youre not done yet! You have to write a lab report on the lab. A full lab report is between 20 and 35 pages depending on your writing style big figures or not, etc and it is hard to write. The lab report is due for the first session of the next lab so generally the very next week. Dont panic yet, bioc220 will go slowly, you dont do a full report the first week but add the 45 different sections of a lab report one by one. It is only by lab 45 that you do a full lab report. Bioc320 is the same except you already know how to make lab reports so you start full reports from the first lab.

As you can see already, the course demands a LOT of your time, your other courses will often be sacrificed for it so plan accordingly and do stuff in advance!

DO NOT USE CHATGPT, thats literally so cringe and youre trying to learn, not use false info from imaginary sources. Writing info in your own words like for the intro part of your report is a great way to learn the theory for the quizzes if you do your intro in advance AND for the final exam! DO NOT copy your friends lab report, groups are small so the same TA will maybe correct the two copies and it will so obvious.

Here are a few manuals I found useful back then. You can easily find them on the mcgill library website as an ebook or through libgen. If youre looking for one specifically, I may be able to send it to you.  



Molecular Biology, 2022, seventh edition, Alberts, Heald, Johnson et al

This one is the bioc212 textbook but its also good for basic theory



Molecular Cell Biology, 2021, ninth ed, Lodish

This is the biol200 textbook, also good for basic theory



Physical Chemistry for the chemical and Biological sciences, Raymond Chang

This is the physical Chem textbook but its useful for that one lab that uses enzyme kinetics. I couldnt find a web version so I used the physical book.



Analytical Techniques in Biochemistry, 2020, Mahin Basha

This is useful for basic techniques theory and for the immunofluorescence stuff. 



Recombinant DNA principles and Methodologies, 1998, edited by James J Greene and Venigalla B Rao

This was a holy grail I found. It has lots of info on pretty much all the experiments you do during the semester even if its a little older. It gives great detail and is super useful. Dont forget to reference each chapter separately since the authors are different. 



DNA Cloning A HandsOn Approach, 2019, SeokYong Choi, Hyunju Ro, Hankuil Yi

This offers more theory on the different techniques to diversify  offers info not found in other sources.



Electrophoresis  Theory and Practice, 2020, Budin Michov

Theory specifically for the electrophoresis procedures. 



Polymerase Chain Reaction for Biomedical Applications, 2016, edited by Ali Samadikuchaksaraei

More for bioc320, this is theory for the PCR reaction and the formulas used. The chapters are to be cited individually. 



The Microbiology by OpenStax found for free online is useful for all the E.coli experiments to characterize bacteriaresistanceetc.



Molecular Cloning A laboratory Manual, 2001, Joe Sambrook

This one is harder to find online but it defines many experiments and why!! reactants and steps are performed, something you need to find for intros. I think many experiments in bioc at mcgill use this manual to make their labs. 



Protein Purification Applications, second edition, 2001, edited by Simon Roe

Again, good to define protein purification steps.



Methods in Enzymology Guide to Protein Purification, 2nd edition, 2009, edited by Richard R Burgess and Murray P Deutscher

Idem as previous textbook. 



Now I know research can be a little hard since it is a little more different more highschool and cegep but you have more resources! mcgill does not often tell you about it, did you know you can use criterion and other websites to watch movies for free?. The mcgill library website is great, offers many manuals as ebooks and makes so many websites offer research papers for free pubmed, elsevier, sciencedirect, etc.

How to research Stuff?

Youre looking for a specific data ex What is the extinction coefficient of DNA?   Use Google scholar for that number  the units and you will find it easily. Just cite that source and voila. I didnt use google scholars often since I found it not precisescientific enough but it can be a good tool for specific inquiries. 

Youre looking for a technique ex what is PCR?   use a general biologybiochemistry textbook for basic info  A more specific textbook for deeper info. To find textbooks, use the mcgill library site, enter the name of the technique and look through the books filter for ebook online and biochembiomedical stuff. The McGill library site is pretty good for that.

Youre looking for stuff even more niche ex what is bgalactosidase? Xgal? How does it work?   I often use ScienceDirect through the mcgill library site so its free which offers great filtering  it does pages with basic info for a specific inquiry from multiple sources. PubMed is good too but you cant find stuff easily there bad filtering options. Use PubMed to obtain the source citation the bioc citation is the APA citation with a few differences.

Searching Tips and Advice for Joint Honours EconAccounting,"Hi! Im a current Arts U0 student and am thinking about choosing the Joint Honours EconAccounting when I start U1. I feel like economics and accounting are a great combination for both learning practical skills, economics theories and math.

1. Does this combination make me more competitive in the job market or help me if I want to start my own business in the future? Im still not certain about my specific career path, but Ill definitely pursue the best salaries and good money!
2. Are there any better options Joint Honors and Honors for example for Arts students similar to this programrelated to economics?
3. Accounting is always a great subject to learn, and accountants are always highly demanded. I also hear people saying that accounting skills not only make you an accountant but also help you manage a company financially. However, I dont know whether Economics is also a practical subject that you can apply to real life. How do Economics and all those statistics relate to managing a company or simply why is it important in real life?

Lousy grade first semester ,"Long story short, just got first semester grades back, and I shart the bed due to not sufficiently preparing for a final in a class that was super relevant to what I want to research, and ended up with a B instead of the A to A I was hoping for. Missed a lot of lectures. It was an 830 never again. 

A B first semester in and of itself doesnt sound bad, but beyond the significance for my research interests, I guess the worst part of it is that I couldve done so much better if I wasnt so irresponsible, attended all of the lectures, and overcame my anxiousness to do some surface level studying. 

Im inclined to take this as a learning experience, and try to use it to motivate me to do really well in the follow up 300 level class. I like the professor. But Im worried that underperforming in the 200 level will be a blemish on my transcript, that communicates a certain level of apathy or insufficient grasp of the course material that will hurt me after I graduate.

Recovering from a bad gpa in my first semester ,"Im in my second year now but my first years first semester GPA still haunts me. Not only that but it actually demotivates me.

My second sem grades last year were milesss better but once again my overall gpa is still pretty low and idk how long it would take for it to recover or if it even will by the time I graduate.

It just sucks because its not really representative of my capabilities at McGill and is already harming my chances of going on exchange, grad school, etc.

"transferring out of eng, wanting to do med after UG","Hello,
I joined eng as an international earlier this year just because I was on the fence with what I wanted to do with my future and I was good at science and math. I figured I really wanted to do medicine always wanted to do it i guess. So my two options are, I either switch to a pre med major pharma or anything in science or I stay in eng. 
My problem with switching is I have none of the bio pre reqs. However switching would make me graduate earlier. Therefor getting a headstart, also I do have financial motivations for finishing earlier I get lots financial aid b4 the age of 23.
On the other hand, I could do the required pre med classes alongside my eng degree, which would give me a degree that I can get a job with if med isnt in the cards for me. However added the courseload of med pre reqs probably means minimum 5 years. Engineering workload in terms of understanding is manageable, but 18 credit semesters doesnt seem chill..

In arts it says that you can apply for a deferral if you havent already taken an exam but Im not sure how true that is. Not to mention I tested the exam when I wasnt sick so I dont even know if I can apply for a deferral in the first place. Im at a loss here.

I hate poli sci grading,"Hey guys! 

As the title states I am sick of this poli sci grading scheme. Yes I understand that I go to McGill and yes whatever blah blah top school. WHY IS THE HIGHEST GRADE AN 86?? First the normal grading and now the conferences also. Why is nothing out of 100 anymore. I get back papers and midterms and they are like great!, very well written, exceptional and then they slap a 7078 on it. How does that make sense. It feels like the TAs want to get back at their undergrad experience and make you die because they also did. I think if u give a rubric which is rare and you give me a question to answer and I DO GIVE ME THE GRADE PLEASEEEEEEEEEE

its like they never want u to just do well. In stem majors, if you understand a topic well, you get a 90 or whatever, because you really got it. Then, on the final, you understood less material but the 90 helps even it out. In this godforsaken major of poli sci because you never receive more than a 86 usually it means that if I get something really well,  and by some miracle I get an 86 with literally not a single piece of feedback. Later, when I get a 72 cause I rly didnt grasp it, THERE IS NOTHING TO BALANCE IT OUT.

I am fighting for nothing. I am fighting for the next TA to take out their undergrad experience on me.

Please either also complain with me or give me hope.

COMP303 Martin is this man fr? ,"Students are asking legitimate questions, and this is what the professor responds... 010

start quote 

FYI you wont get an answer. The teacher mentioned staff would stop monitoring ed after Dec. 9th. I find that ridiculous.

The McGill final exam period runs from December 6th to December 20th, i.e., over two weeks. The teaching staff has no control over when the exam is scheduled. 

Meanwhile, course support activities office hours, forum monitoring, email have a personnel cost. The TA hour budget provided for a course is fixed, and not adjusted based on the date of the final exam. As for me, the instructor, I have a large number of duties besides teaching a course, and consequently my time budget for the course also has to be fixed to allow me to fulfill my other responsibilities. 

Given these parameters, I provided, one week before the end of classes, a detailed playbook on the final course activities. First, these support activities included largely increased office hours availability, and second, these support activities extended beyond the end of classes and into the exam period. When some courses were already done and the staff disbanded, the COMP 303 team was still supporting you.

Studio 2 exams RANT,"I just walked out of an exam in studio 2, and call me crazy, but I dont think the hardest part of an exam should be the splitting headache induced by what can only be equated to a cruise ship docking outside your window. 

The mechanical room, conveniently located about a meter away from my seat, would emit an ear splitting noise at random intervals. from 30s5min. To visualize this noise, imagine someone starting a diesel generator while holding an air horn. 

Combine this with the absolute god awful chairs provided, plus maybe the worst formatted exam Ive seen in the past 4 years, and youve got a recipe for subpar performance. 

After being subjected to this grating, painful noise about a dozen times in the first hour, I figured hey, maybe I can move to a different room! Or at least a desk further away from the missile siren. But alas, after asking an invigilator, who in turn asked another invigilator, who in turn left the room and reappeared several minutes later presumably to chain the request to someone higher up in some twisted game of telephone, the request was shut down.

Upon finishing the last question of this piss poor 30 page exam not double sided for some reason, where half the questions are presented on different pages as the relevant info leading to an obnoxious amount of page flipping I elected to not even check my answers, instead just flipping through to verify everything had an exam, and rushing out to get painkillers from the closest pharmacy, lest the pain skew my judgement and instead lead to more errors.

Avoid renting from Akelius Montreal at all costsyoull end up losing your money,"I was previously a tenant at 539 Rue Prince Arthur, Montreal, Quebec H2X 1T6, a property owned by Akelius Montreal, located near McGill University. You can find their homepage at Akelius Renthttpsrent.akelius.com. I no longer reside at this property.

After moving out, I mistakenly transferred 25,000 to their building managers TD Bank account. Despite repeated attempts to resolve the issue, Akelius refused to return my money, providing fabricated excuses and inconsistent responses. Their lack of accountability resulted in multiple unresolved service tickets and unnecessary delays. I am now preparing to take legal action against them.

Beyond this financial ordeal, my experience as a tenant was equally appalling. The property was infested with ants and cockroaches, yet they never took action to address the issue. Unfortunately, my case is not an isolated incident. Many others have shared similar negative experiences, as seen in this Reddit threadhttpswww.reddit.comrmontrealcomments14qxop8dontrentfromakeliusoranybigproperty.

"Pretty sure I failed math 139, what do I do?","So in high school I always was pretty good at math. I studied hard and worked hard and I saw results. But now at McGill, I have been struggling in math. Its not even that the math is hard, its just that I freeze up and panic when I take tests sometimes.

I just had my math 139 final and I totally bombed it. I probably got a 20 on it and I already did so bad on the midterm that theres no way Im gonna pass. Its not even like Im doing bad in my other classes! I have As in all of them right now. I went to math office hours every week, I went to every single lecture, and I began studying for this final two and a half weeks ago. I literally did every goddamn thing in my power to do what I could to study, and I still ended up failing  I even recorded like 40 hours worth of time lapses of me studying so I could make one of those studying as a McGill student videos, as well as for the fact that I needed proof that I was truly trying my best because my parents would doubt that I even studied if I failed  

Im just feeling very discouraged. I even took one less class this semester so I could do good in math 139. I took the class pass fail, but still, Im pretty sure I need it for my degree. Im in arts but Im majoring in Environment and Development, so its the only math class I wouldve had to take. I literally studied day in and day out and didnt even hang out with people for weeks, just so I could do good on my final. And then I sit down and just blank. This kind of thing has never even happened to me before. What do I do now? Can I convince the prof to raise my grade or encourage him to do a curve or something? If everyone else did bad, will there be a curve? Its his first year teaching, so Im wondering if that will affect the final grade. If everyone does terribly, will the blame come onto him and hell be forced to curve? Im just pissed off because i literally was studying so hard over the course of two weeks that i started developing heart problems  like it was bad enough that my doctor was like you should get an EKG. If studying and maximizing your time to the point your heart starts beating weird isnt enough to pass a class, then I dont know what is 

But overall, what will happen next? Do I just have to retake the class? Or do I do a supplemental exam?

 On SPHR and the impeachment,"I attended last weeks general assembly, whose attendance was visibly segregated by a majority of SPHR supporters and a minority of nonaffiliated people. Watching the majority of members talk and ask staged questions provided really good insight about SPHR, what they want, and their modus operandi.

It is clear, from what I saw at the assembly, that SPHR is angered at SSMU for not holding a referendum to vote on a studentwide strike in support of Palestine which would have occurred in November  a result of poor organization and the lack of understanding of student government. In retaliation, they are trying to impeach the SSMU president as a scapegoat.

SPHR arent the only ones to blame for the lack of action in support of Palestine  the SSMU president does have some responsibility for this, but has apologized during the meeting. However, as a result of the ongoing provincial injunctionhttpsssmu.cablog202408statementregardinglegalupdates and McGills response to their protests, SPHR doesnt seem to understand their role in preventing SSMUendorsed student action from moving forward.

Some details that are particularly relevant to what is going on were brought up and I dont think are thought about enough especially since SPHR members at the assembly compared McGill quite a bit to other universities in Quebec

1. SPHR approached the SSMU about a student strike months later than student unions at other Quebec universities as per VP speeches during the general assembly, expecting things to be done in a similar timeline. I hate the SSMUs slow bureaucratic process as much as anyone else, but one would have to be a fool to think that they could escape it, and they should have been thinking about this when organizing the strike.
2. It is clear that SPHR does not approve of the Quebec legal frameworkhttpswww.instagram.compC0CkzMSgph6?igshMXkxNXA4cWs2aXFtZA, and would like to ignore the injunction against SSMU. It is all well and good to disapprove, but to force our government to ignore the law is merely a way of throwing more student money out the window in legal fees. This is a very real threat for the SSMU. Yes, our university didnt hold a strike like other Quebec universities, but we also have an INJUNCTION against policies voted in by the student body.
3. SPHR membersaffiliates had little comprehension of student government. The consensus of people in various student governments attending the meeting was that the SPHR members present had little grasp of how student government and the SSMU in particular functions. As a result, their questionsargumentsdiscussion points either were not technically possible through the means established or made little sense in the framework of student government. I understand that they want to change that framework, but right now, it is the framework we are working under.

They are a real threat to the McGill student body enacting real change  but especially, they are a threat to the money that SSMU takes out of the pockets of McGill students every semester. Impeachment will very possibly lead to another famous SSMU president lawsuit, and potentially violations of the injunction, which will do nothing but waste even greater excesses of student money.

SPHR is also becoming divorced from their original goalshttpswww.instagram.compC6XYo7oriMK?igshenE4NThqbWc1YmZt. By using inflammatory language and controversial imageryhttpswww.instagram.compC8Ird8rsGx?igsheHF3MDVtdTFrcXgy, they alienate student support for their cause. They should not be allowed to set this precedent, nor this president in what is effectively a SSMU coup, and you should consider voting to keep the existing SSMU president in when the vote gets to students this Monday.

In other words, even if you voted for the Policy Against Genocide in Palestine, this impeachment will not change the fact that there is an injunction against it, and will just cost students more and make the SSMU even worse.",1733758428,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1hacd4i/on_sphr_and_the_impeachment/,23,sassafrass011,1hacd4i,12/9/2024 15:33,"['attended', 'last', 'weeks', 'general', 'assembly', 'whose', 'attendance', 'visibly', 'segregated', 'majority', 'sphr', 'supporters', 'minority', 'nonaffiliated', 'people.', 'watching', 'majority', 'members', 'talk', 'ask', 'staged', 'questions', 'provided', 'really', 'good', 'insight', 'sphr', 'want', 'modus', 'operandi.', 'clear', 'saw', 'assembly', 'sphr', 'angered', 'ssmu', 'holding', 'referendum', 'vote', 'studentwide', 'strike', 'support', 'palestine', 'would', 'occurred', 'november', 'result', 'poor', 'organization', 'lack', 'understanding', 'student', 'government.', 'retaliation', 'trying', 'impeach', 'ssmu', 'president', 'scapegoat.', 'sphr', 'arent', 'ones', 'blame', 'lack', 'action', 'support', 'palestine', 'ssmu', 'president', 'responsibility', 'apologized', 'meeting.', 'however', 'result', 'ongoing', 'provincial', 'injunction', 'mcgills', 'response', 'protests', 'sphr', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'understand', 'role', 'preventing', 'ssmuendorsed', 'student', 'action', 'moving', 'forward.', 'details', 'particularly', 'relevant', 'going', 'brought', 'dont', 'think', 'thought', 'enough', 'especially', 'since', 'sphr', 'members', 'assembly', 'compared', 'mcgill', 'quite', 'bit', 'universities', 'quebec', '.', 'sphr', 'approached', 'ssmu', 'student', 'strike', 'months', 'later', 'student', 'unions', 'quebec', 'universities', 'per', 'vp', 'speeches', 'general', 'assembly', 'expecting', 'things', 'done', 'similar', 'timeline.', 'hate', 'ssmus', 'slow', 'bureaucratic', 'process', 'much', 'anyone', 'else', 'one', 'would', 'fool', 'think', 'could', 'escape', 'thinking', 'organizing', 'strike.', '.', 'clear', 'sphr', 'approve', 'quebec', 'legal', 'framework', 'would', 'like', 'ignore', 'injunction', 'ssmu.', 'well', 'good', 'disapprove', 'force', 'government', 'ignore', 'law', 'merely', 'way', 'throwing', 'student', 'money', 'window', 'legal', 'fees.', 'real', 'threat', 'ssmu.', 'yes', 'university', 'didnt', 'hold', 'strike', 'like', 'quebec', 'universities', 'also', 'injunction', 'policies', 'voted', 'student', 'body.', '.', 'sphr', 'membersaffiliates', 'little', 'comprehension', 'student', 'government.', 'consensus', 'people', 'various', 'student', 'governments', 'attending', 'meeting', 'sphr', 'members', 'present', 'little', 'grasp', 'student', 'government', 'ssmu', 'particular', 'functions.', 'result', 'questionsargumentsdiscussion', 'points', 'either', 'technically', 'possible', 'means', 'established', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'framework', 'student', 'government.', 'understand', 'want', 'change', 'framework', 'right', 'framework', 'working', 'under.', 'real', 'threat', 'mcgill', 'student', 'body', 'enacting', 'real', 'change', 'especially', 'threat', 'money', 'ssmu', 'takes', 'pockets', 'mcgill', 'students', 'every', 'semester.', 'impeachment', 'possibly', 'lead', 'another', 'famous', 'ssmu', 'president', 'lawsuit', 'potentially', 'violations', 'injunction', 'nothing', 'waste', 'even', 'greater', 'excesses', 'student', 'money.', 'sphr', 'also', 'becoming', 'divorced', 'original', 'goals', 'using', 'inflammatory', 'language', 'controversial', 'imagery', 'alienate', 'student', 'support', 'cause.', 'allowed', 'set', 'precedent', 'president', 'effectively', 'ssmu', 'coup', 'consider', 'voting', 'keep', 'existing', 'ssmu', 'president', 'vote', 'gets', 'students', 'monday.', 'words', 'even', 'voted', 'policy', 'genocide', 'palestine', 'impeachment', 'change', 'fact', 'injunction', 'cost', 'students', 'make', 'ssmu', 'even', 'worse.']",1,0,0,0

However, meeting the strike dates of November 25th to 29th was not possible due to  logistical requirements, namely organizing a special general assembly, conducting a weeklong referendum, and ratifying the results before proceeding with a public call to strike.

In line with this legal guidance, the revised motion was sent to SSMUs legal counsel for review on November 14th. 

Putting aside my thoughts about student strikes, I dont even understand what the issue with the President here. Here is the timeline I gathered

 Nov 5th, their motion is put in front of the SSMU Steering Committee who decides probably dont do it because its exactly the same as the one that got injuncted

 Nov 8th, President sends out an email that the politburo has decided is not true legally based on what? He apologizes and accepts accountability

 Nov 13th, the revised motion was put in front of the Steering Committee but by then it was too late as logistically it couldnt come into effect by the dates that it mentioned. This is their own fault, I dont understand, if revising it why not change the dates to give some breathing room logisticswise?

 Nov 14th, they send the revised motion to SSMUs lawyers to check over.... and then thats it

So, he is getting impeached because the executive council thinks he was wrong about a legal thing? thats it? If theres another reason, why not put it in the email...  
If someone was at the actual GA and could share if they made any additional complaints against the president that would be helpful to trying to understand wtf is going on.",1733451406,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1h7qmyg/todays_email_from_ssmu_about_the_impeachment/,16,LordGodBaphomet,1h7qmyg,12/6/2024 2:16,"['ive', 'copied', 'core', 'message', 'november', 'th', 'initial', 'motion', 'submitted', 'ssmu', 'steering', 'committee', 'titled', 'student', 'solidarity', 'strike', 'genocide', 'palestine', 'steering', 'committee', 'concluded', 'language', 'nearly', 'identical', 'policy', 'genocide', 'palestine', 'pagip', 'injunction', 'since', 'november', 'summarized', 'november', 'th', 'president', 'taylor', 'sent', 'email', 'incorrectly', 'stating', 'motion', 'strike', 'support', 'palestine', 'would', 'violate', 'injunction', 'pagip', 'executive', 'committee', 'communicated', 'president', 'taylor', 'misconstruction', 'legal', 'constraints', 'serious', 'misstep.', 'president', 'taylor', 'since', 'apologized', 'mistake', 'continue', 'accept', 'accountability.', 'new', 'motion', 'titled', 'strike', 'support', 'palestinian', 'liberation', 'submitted', 'steering', 'committee', 'november', 'th.', 'motion', 'significantly', 'revised', 'per', 'guidelines', 'provided', 'ssmu', 'steering', 'committee.', 'however', 'meeting', 'strike', 'dates', 'november', 'th', 'th', 'possible', 'due', 'logistical', 'requirements', 'namely', 'organizing', 'special', 'general', 'assembly', 'conducting', 'weeklong', 'referendum', 'ratifying', 'results', 'proceeding', 'public', 'call', 'strike.', 'legal', 'opinion', 'written', 'ssmus', 'legal', 'counsel', 'january', 'nd', 'says', 'ssmu', 'consult', 'lawyers', 'proceeding', 'motions', 'relating', 'pagip.', 'line', 'legal', 'guidance', 'revised', 'motion', 'sent', 'ssmus', 'legal', 'counsel', 'review', 'november', 'th.', 'putting', 'aside', 'thoughts', 'student', 'strikes', 'dont', 'even', 'understand', 'issue', 'president', 'here.', 'timeline', 'gathered', 'nov', 'th', 'motion', 'put', 'front', 'ssmu', 'steering', 'committee', 'decides', 'probably', 'dont', 'exactly', 'one', 'got', 'injuncted', 'nov', 'th', 'president', 'sends', 'email', 'politburo', 'decided', 'true', 'legally', 'based', 'what?', 'apologizes', 'accepts', 'accountability', 'nov', 'th', 'revised', 'motion', 'put', 'front', 'steering', 'committee', 'late', 'logistically', 'couldnt', 'come', 'effect', 'dates', 'mentioned.', 'fault', 'dont', 'understand', 'revising', 'change', 'dates', 'give', 'breathing', 'room', 'logisticswise?', 'nov', 'th', 'send', 'revised', 'motion', 'ssmus', 'lawyers', 'check', 'over....', 'thats', 'getting', 'impeached', 'executive', 'council', 'thinks', 'wrong', 'legal', 'thing?', 'thats', 'it?', 'theres', 'another', 'reason', 'put', 'email...', 'someone', 'actual', 'ga', 'could', 'share', 'made', 'additional', 'complaints', 'president', 'would', 'helpful', 'trying', 'understand', 'wtf', 'going', 'on.']",0,0,0,0

McGill TAs being less engaged after the strike?,"Im not sure if this is typical, but it was my first time attending a final review session where the TA admitted he hadnt prepared anything. Instead, he asked us to study on our own and ask questions if needed. Most people left right away after he said this, and it made me question the purpose of a final review session if its just selfstudy. Since the strike, Ive noticed that some TAs seem less engaged compared to before, when they would explain concepts during tutorials, which I found very helpful. This semester, most TAs simply post problems, have us work in groups, and then provide the answers at the end. Im not sure if this is a common experience or if Im the only one feeling this way.

Library Lurker McLennan,"Kind of weird situation happening to girls at McGill, wondering if its happened to anyone else. Basically, this 40ish year old man around 6ft tall with a beard has been lurking on 5th and 6th floor of McLennan, he will come up to female students and ask them for a pen. After being given a pen, he leaves and comes back 5 mins later and puts the pen and a green post it note down with a message, image attached. He did this to three of my friends in 2022 and he just did it again yesterday on 5th floor of McLennan, it is the exact same message every time and the weirdcreepy part is that he underlines different numbers for each girl he gives a postit to, also hes evidently not a student as he walks around with nothing but a small book.  We reported it to security and they had never had any other reports but after speaking to some friends apparently he is doing the same thing at the Concordia library. I blocked out two of the digits of the phone number because I dont think Reddit will allow me to post the full number

I also heard given the work load i wouldnt find much time to take up part time in thesis based course and that makes sense since i saw there were 4 thesis researches to be completed  is this true? 
On checking the program costs the thesis based is far cheaper and thats tempting but i dont wanna get into it and regret later for not making the right choice for my requirements.

Deferring an exam for the second time in one year for similar reasons.,"So I just went through the toughest time in my life this semester. I didnt attend a single lecture and I didnt do any studying at all. I was failing 4 out of 4 courses as a compsci major and my highest midterm grade was a solid 60. The only work Ive ever done was completing assignemnts last minute using chatgpt.

I was so depressed I would spend my entire days sleeping and wake up in the afternoon. And once I woke up I would eat and go back to sleep lol. It was really bad and the hardest part was hiding it from my friends and my parents.

Anyways, things got a lot better about 2 weeks ago when I walked out of my fifth midterm of the semester that I obviously failed again. I suddenly regained some motivation and for the past 2 weeks Ive been cramming hard at the library for 68 hours a day. I managed to clutch up 34 courses. I will no longer be failing them but I dont think I can pass my last final exam. I consulted my professor and he also said theres a super low chance of passing andn he recommended me to defer it.

The problem is I already used my free deferral in Winter 2024 for similar reasons. Back then I wasnt as depressed and the symptoms werent as bad, but I fell asleep in every lecture for that course since it was at 9am and I couldnt complete the final exam. I submitted my deferral without supporting documentation and passed the exam in the summer.

The difference this time is that I have medical notes. I dont have a family doctor on the waiting list, but Ive been to two clinics so far and received official medical notes from two doctors for reasons like sleeping disorder, fatigue, unable to concentrate, trouble dadaptation, anxiety, depression. The medical notes were written using the mcgill template.

What are the chances they accept my deferral this time? I have decent supporting documentation and my transcript this semester shows how hard Ive struggled. My professor also recommends me to defer. Do yall think if I submit my medical notes and write a lengthy application they would accept it again for similar reasons as last time?

Feeling Hopeless About My McGill and Visa SituationSeeking Advice or encouragement  ,"I applied to a Masters program at McGill last year, and I was ecstatic when I got accepted around March 2024. I chose this program after a lot of research, I couldnt find anything else that aligns with my goals as much as this program did. My partner was fully supportive and ready to move to Montreal with me. My family has a trust fund dedicated to my education, and I was confident wed easily handle all the migration requirementseven though Canada had imposed stricter rules for Mexican citizens, which we are.

I optioned the CAQ with no issues, but things got difficult when it came to the Visa and Study Permit for me  Work Permit for my partner. We were denied both permits, citing insufficient funds. We tried again, submitting more funds, and were denied a second time. By that point, I had one final chance to reapply since it takes ages to have a respond form applications. I reached out to McGills International Student Services and had a Zoom consultation with their immigration advisor, who went through all our documents and told me that everything looked fineexcept for the fact that we are Mexican. She said that that she was really sorry to say so but if we were from another country, our funds would be more than enough. That moment hit me hard and I started to seriously doubt my plans.

We reapplied a third time, following all the advisors suggestions, including adding a breakdown of expenses showing why our funds were more than sufficient according to Canadian immigration requirements. By this point, if the application was approved, Id still be late for the Fall 2024 term, so I informed the Administrative Student Affairs Coordinator for my program. Im incredibly grateful to him because hes been so supportive from the start, offering solutions and reassuring me that if things didnt work out, I could join in Fall 2025.

The third application came back with more reasons for refusalthis time, they claimed we didnt provide enough proof that my partner would return to Mexico after my program was over, even though we included a letter from his employer confirming he had a twoyear leave and would be expected back after that.



This week, I received a letter offering me admission for Fall 2025, but honestly, I feel completely hopeless. Im so afraid that this whole plan is impossible, and Im less hopeful because the political climate seems even worse. Even if our application is approved, Im terrified of being in a country that doesnt seem to want me there. Its so frustrating because for me, this is more than just an academic opportunityits a chance to advance my career in a way that will help me grow professionally back home in Mexico. I dont even want to stay in Canada longtermI love living in Mexico City, and my partners industry is flourishing here in a way that is not in Canada.

This degree from McGill could help level the playing field for us since right now, I cant even grow in my fieldIm stuck working in a call center because the job market is flooded with people with just undergrad degrees form Mexican Universities, like me. The McGill program isnt just about my academic interest its about standing out in my field in Mexico, and that could make a huge difference for my future.

Im really scared for both me and my partner. Hes willing to make so many sacrifices to support me, including putting his promising career on hold for two years, here in Mexico hi has a position that he knows he wont be able to have in Montreal, just so I can advance my opportunities. But Im so afraid of him having a bad experience, being discriminated against, and facing racist or xenophobic treatment since he is clearly Mexican while im white passing.

Im just feeling lost, and I dont know what to do anymore. Does anyone have advice or suggestions? Has anyone faced something similar? Any words of encouragement would mean the world to me right now.",1733320781,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1h6gn12/feeling_hopeless_about_my_mcgill_and_visa/,9,luna_en_escorpio,1h6gn12,12/4/2024 13:59,"['applied', 'masters', 'program', 'mcgill', 'last', 'year', 'ecstatic', 'got', 'accepted', 'around', 'march', '.', 'chose', 'program', 'lot', 'research', 'couldnt', 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'aligns', 'goals', 'much', 'program', 'did.', 'partner', 'fully', 'supportive', 'ready', 'move', 'montreal', 'me.', 'family', 'trust', 'fund', 'dedicated', 'education', 'confident', 'wed', 'easily', 'handle', 'migration', 'requirementseven', 'though', 'canada', 'imposed', 'stricter', 'rules', 'mexican', 'citizens', 'are.', 'optioned', 'caq', 'issues', 'things', 'got', 'difficult', 'came', 'visa', 'study', 'permit', 'work', 'permit', 'partner.', 'denied', 'permits', 'citing', 'insufficient', 'funds.', 'tried', 'submitting', 'funds', 'denied', 'second', 'time.', 'point', 'one', 'final', 'chance', 'reapply', 'since', 'takes', 'ages', 'respond', 'form', 'applications.', 'reached', 'mcgills', 'international', 'student', 'services', 'zoom', 'consultation', 'immigration', 'advisor', 'went', 'documents', 'told', 'everything', 'looked', 'fineexcept', 'fact', 'mexican.', 'said', 'really', 'sorry', 'say', 'another', 'country', 'funds', 'would', 'enough.', 'moment', 'hit', 'hard', 'started', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'plans.', 'reapplied', 'third', 'time', 'following', 'advisors', 'suggestions', 'including', 'adding', 'breakdown', 'expenses', 'showing', 'funds', 'sufficient', 'according', 'canadian', 'immigration', 'requirements.', 'point', 'application', 'approved', 'id', 'still', 'late', 'fall', 'term', 'informed', 'administrative', 'student', 'affairs', 'coordinator', 'program.', 'im', 'incredibly', 'grateful', 'hes', 'supportive', 'start', 'offering', 'solutions', 'reassuring', 'things', 'didnt', 'work', 'could', 'join', 'fall', '.', 'third', 'application', 'came', 'back', 'reasons', 'refusalthis', 'time', 'claimed', 'didnt', 'provide', 'enough', 'proof', 'partner', 'would', 'return', 'mexico', 'program', 'even', 'though', 'included', 'letter', 'employer', 'confirming', 'twoyear', 'leave', 'would', 'expected', 'back', 'that.', 'week', 'received', 'letter', 'offering', 'admission', 'fall', 'honestly', 'feel', 'completely', 'hopeless.', 'im', 'afraid', 'whole', 'plan', 'impossible', 'im', 'less', 'hopeful', 'political', 'climate', 'seems', 'even', 'worse.', 'even', 'application', 'approved', 'im', 'terrified', 'country', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'want', 'there.', 'frustrating', 'academic', 'opportunityits', 'chance', 'advance', 'career', 'way', 'help', 'grow', 'professionally', 'back', 'home', 'mexico.', 'dont', 'even', 'want', 'stay', 'canada', 'longtermi', 'love', 'living', 'mexico', 'city', 'partners', 'industry', 'flourishing', 'way', 'canada.', 'degree', 'mcgill', 'could', 'help', 'level', 'playing', 'field', 'us', 'since', 'right', 'cant', 'even', 'grow', 'fieldim', 'stuck', 'working', 'call', 'center', 'job', 'market', 'flooded', 'people', 'undergrad', 'degrees', 'form', 'mexican', 'universities', 'like', 'me.', 'mcgill', 'program', 'isnt', 'academic', 'interest', 'standing', 'field', 'mexico', 'could', 'make', 'huge', 'difference', 'future.', 'im', 'really', 'scared', 'partner.', 'hes', 'willing', 'make', 'many', 'sacrifices', 'support', 'including', 'putting', 'promising', 'career', 'hold', 'two', 'years', 'mexico', 'hi', 'position', 'knows', 'wont', 'able', 'montreal', 'advance', 'opportunities.', 'im', 'afraid', 'bad', 'experience', 'discriminated', 'facing', 'racist', 'xenophobic', 'treatment', 'since', 'clearly', 'mexican', 'im', 'white', 'passing.', 'im', 'feeling', 'lost', 'dont', 'know', 'anymore.', 'anyone', 'advice', 'suggestions?', 'anyone', 'faced', 'something', 'similar?', 'words', 'encouragement', 'would', 'mean', 'world', 'right', 'now.']",1,0,0,0

Stressed About Math 318 Final  Lack of Resources ,"


Im feeling super overwhelmed about the Math 318 final. It feels like theres not enough resources to really prepare for it properly. The textbook explanations are dense, and I feel like theres a gap between whats taught in class and what shows up on practice problems.

Ive gone through the lecture notes and past assignments, but its still not clicking the way I need it to. There arent many practice exams or extra examples that are the type of questions were expected to solve.

Is anyone else feeling the same? If youve taken the course before or have tips on how to prep efficiently with limited resources, Id appreciate any advice. I just want to walk into the exam feeling somewhat confident instead of completely lost.

Good luck to everyone else in the same boat! Lets get through this.

Which 300 level biology major requirement classes are best to take? and how is BIOL 314,"Hi!

Squirrel observation fr alum,"Hello McGill community this is a random urban studies observation. Im not in urban studies Im in a liberal arts master program at ubc rn. Graduated in 2023. Based in Vancouver atm, miss mtl and McGill.

My random observation is that there seems to be less squirrels on ubc campus than on McGill, which surprises me a little as UBC is supposed to the best preserved in terms of nature, and that ubc is located in the suburbs rather than McGill which is downtown.

My very unprofessional presumption is the way the ubc campus is planned is, against all odds, very not parklife as compared to McGill. I remember sitting on the benches and stairs near burnside in fall times, and people chilling on the grass field in front of Redpath museum. A lot of squirrels and it feels like a big cozy park. Whereas ubc, it feels like a nonplace, people come and go, a lot of empty concrete grounds, and the fact that ubc situates itself at the end of highwayssorta. Vancouver too is also a car city so I guess that might be a factor.

They are both pretty campuses dont get me wrong. Personally I prefer McGill as its close downtown. But this is just a random yap from an alumni.

Really bad GPA going back to cegep? ,"Hello, if you saw this post twice, then my bad  I accidentally posted this with my main account and forgot my family follows me on that one....

Im in my second year of CS and I genuinely hate what I be doing right now. I stayed for this long since I thought it would get better but nope and my parents are only willing to pay for my tuition if I went into this program at McGill, otherwise, Id have to pay the tuition on my own.

Im doing horrible, my GPA is so bad Im nearing academic probation. Im really not interested in this field, Id rather go for a medical career but my GPA really screwed me up I literally cant apply to any health related undergraduates.

So now Im looking at technical medical programs in Cegep or career programs some would say, but theyre hella competitive to get in .
 I might have a chance since I have a DEC in health sciences, but Im just scared that CEGEPs check my uni grades and reject me instantly....

chem204  physical chemistry fall 2024 what is happening,"i dont like being super pessimistic and negative but this course has left me with no other choice 

i think i can confidently say rustam is the worst prof i have ever had, his lectures are unintelligible and i dont think ive had a clue whats been going on the entire course. his slides arent too bad although mostly just deriving formulas, but the textbook is really carrying all of us as i dont think he has explained a single thing to sufficiency the entire semester. 
when he does speak, his sentences will often just trail off into nothingness letting us just miss some important information that we wouldnt have heard anyway because of how intense he chooses to mumble. 
its fascinating how a lot of the things he has taught have been things i have learned to a lesser extent in past courses and yet he manages to explain it in such a way that makes me feel like its completely foreign to me. sitting in his lectures feels like im sitting in a course being taught in a different language
the midterm avg was curved up 14 my 54 was 6 above average and he has the audacity to show us past years averages and say look theyre just as bad! im sure the final is gonna be even worse and he said best case scenario the class average could be a 70 which would be very high for this course. what.

"How do you cope with the fact that many of the courses you have to study are just bullshit? I mean, irrelevant and timeconsuming","Im going to keep this short.

Yes, theoretically speaking, everything we study is useful, even if to a lesser extent, and all the programs are carefully tailored to give us the best experience and tools for the real world and so on.

I know, we know. Im also a firm believer that gathering new knowledge, no matter what it is, is always going to be a good thing, BUT

We are paying for an education that sometimes makes us spend a lot of time on projects, assignments, homework, quizzes, exams... that we know for a fact are not realistic when it comes to whats actually happening in our fields in my case, confirmed by peers and friends with 20 years of experience in the profession.

Tomorrow, Ill have to spend most of my day a fg Sunday doing homework for a subject that is very demandingnot extremely useless but pretty skippable, as it teaches methods that no one uses. This semester for me has been full of these kinds of situations, and Im kind of done with it. I have a lot of things that are more important to me personally and would make me a better professional, but instead, Im using my time to study something I know Ill forget as soon as I graduate Ive already forgotten many things Ive learned in this program because theyre pointless.

The exam is to be completed in 60 minutes. This was what was written on the syllabus and reiterated in class for the entire semester.

Is a Masters Degree worth pursuing in my case?,"I graduated with a B.Sc in Psychology but I wasnt proactive during it and got no research experience during it, which I now very much regret. Anyways, my plans been to go to graduate school in Neuroscience and application deadline is coming up in a few weeks and I think Im getting cold feet.

Im currently volunteering as a research assistant at a lab and Im enjoying it, so I have a small amount of experience, however definitely not enough for a PhD.

I want to pursue graduate school in Neuroscience, but I keep hearing people say that a masters degree isnt worth the time. Is it worth applying or should I try to get experience and then apply for a PhD at a later time?

Another question, is there anything that a MSc in Neuroscience would do for me that my BSc in Psych wouldnt other than research experience? I have a really high GPA so I dont see a masters degree boosting that in any way.

Ahh McGill! I miss you,"Hi everyone! 

WOW! I cant even begin to explain how much I miss McGill these days! Its like one second Im, and the next second Im hit with this huge wave of nostalgia for walking around campus, especially in the fall when the leaves are all beautiful  did you know squirrels forget about 50 of the nuts they bury?  cloudbury.

Earnestly, I evan miss slipping on the icy McTavish slope in the middle of winter  my old boots stood a chance! Also maybe study sessions at McLennan , awake but fall asleep with your face in a textbook relatable, right? 

And like, anyone else miss grabbing a quick coffee from the Tim s near campus? Or walking down Sherbrooke after class, freezing but alive?  Anyway, I seriously miss those days, even when the snow was piled higher than my ant farms !

Sometimes I even often dream about Montreal poutine at 100 AM EST. Can we just talk about how legendary it is? 

Hope everyone is doing well wherever you are, even if studying or if not!

"Ive studied in Frnch my whole life, is Mcgill still a good option?","TLDR Studying at McGill is a better option for me. Even though Im bilingual, the language barrier regarding scientific vocabulary scares me away from pursuing my studies there. Are there available resources that can help, and can someone guide me based on their own experience or any experience of a similar case they know?

  
I was admitted to Polytechnique this year in engineering. Initially, I couldve gone to McGill, but I feared the language barrier. But now, after rethinking my life goals, I see the pros of studying at McGill and getting an engineering diploma there in my field mining as a way better option for my career and life goals. Lets be clear Im fully bilingual, and I speak and write in English fluently  with ease. However, I have never studied in English. If I had to switch, it would be next year, my 2nd year as a mining engineering student. Its the scientific vocabulary, in general, that scares me. Ill break here all my questions  

 From experience, is it that hard to switch languages in the middle of my studies?  
 Are there resources available to help me with any problem?

Tips for managing time,"I am absolutely dogshit at managing my time between all my different classes. Currently, Im taking Linear algebra, calculus 1, chem 110, and two major related courses and Im just using all of my studying time on linear algebra. Any spare time I might have to study I use it on calc 1. I also alternate between having very productive days like 7 hours of studying with maybe 45 hours of it being productive studying and then the next day I can barely study for like 3 hours. Ive started to skip most of my classes as midterm season has started because it just feels useless to go to class and barely pay attention when I could just be using that time to study at a pace that works best for me. It just feels like the pacing is wrong for me in these huge lecture halls, as the prof
A explains shit way too slowly so I drift off and miss something important
B explains shit way too fast so I drift off and miss something important
C talks in a very convoluted way so I dont even understand what is going on so I drift off and miss something important.

Does anybody have any tips to manage my time better? I just feel like I need to put in that huge time investment into linear algebra, otherwise Ill fail the class because its by far my hardest class. But because Im not putting any time whatsoever into chem and my two other major related courses my grades in those classes have started to suffer.

What McGill is doing with the library is embarrassing,"I get that a lot of people dont access or need physical books anymore, and I get that there is a profound need for more study space on campus, but the idea of a university removing basically all of the books from their library more or less permanently makes my skin crawl. Its the most obvious example of the ongoing dismantlement of higher education Ive ever seen.

 Moving books offsite and only storing a small percent made up of recently requested books means that the vast, VAST majority of the books in the library are going to sit in the offsite robotic storage and rot, never to be requested again. A lot of these books are also not digitized, so by sequestering them offsite, theyre basically gone forever now. You cant look for or request something you dont know about, and you cant discover them on the shelves anymore Ive personally found a lot of hidden gems by going to the library to look for a specific book, then browsing the section of shelving that book is located in.
 If Im writing a paper or manuscript, or working on something, and I realize I need to follow up on a reference in a paper Im planning on citing, or otherwise need a book that I cant find online, I cant just wander over to the library and get it anymore. I now have to go request it, and wait for at least a full day to get it. In that time, the thing Im working on is effectively put on pause. This is now a reality every time I need a book from the library.
 The current request system is not integrated well on the library website. If you want the physical version of something the library has eBook access to, you cant just search for the book, open up its info page, and request it there, you have to back out to the search results, go to the bottom, and hit a tiny details link at the bottom, which will take you to the specific page you need to actually request the physical copy from robotic storage. Its unintuitive, and not signposted anywhere. Its like the library is actively trying to keep you from accessing physical copies of the books at this point.
 This also strikes me as indicative of how little McGill actually cares about learning and research instead of finding an actually reasonable solution to the lack of space on campus, the university just looks for something to effectively destroy and replace, and the longterm consequences be damned. Again, I know most undergrads dont access and use actual books, but grad students and profs do, and a lot of us feel like were getting screwed here just because the university doesnt actually care about either us or undergrads enough to actually figure out a sustainable long term solution to the study space issue on campus.

And now because of the provincial budget changescuts, the Fiat Lux project is now on hold? What does that mean? Do we now get neither a library full of books nor a renovated study space ie. not a library? McGill is so proud of itself, too. Look!

those who overcame laziness and lack of ambition  how? ,"i am the most lazy person i know. the worst part is i cant owe any possible explanation like burnout because its simply my nature and have been doing this for years and my university journey has only just begun. everyone else i know around me is smart and disciplined and i simply cant get to that level.

i have hard times focusing and getting motivation, even when i know the weight of importance for a task. for midterms i have a hard time convincing myself to study for longer periods of time, and when i can, it is hard to focus. i tell myself to wake up early to study and will do everything but. i have small periods of high motivation where i will study for multiple hours a day and consider it a win just to never do it again until a few days or even weeks later. i do generally study everyday tho but its a struggle 

its hard having this conversation with others because obviously other people are very smart and motivated, which is part of the reason they got here.

its a shame because i am only in my first year and school has just begun although this has been a problem for all my life i feel like ive had enough wakeup calls to try to change. but i really do my question my ability to get through the next few years and sometimes consider if it would be best for me to simply just quit before sunk cost hits me. if anyone has advice for me id appreciate it because im getting tired of myself ",1729301547,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1g6y3b6/those_who_overcame_laziness_and_lack_of_ambition/,46,Aluminam382,1g6y3b6,10/19/2024 1:32,"['lazy', 'person', 'know.', 'worst', 'part', 'cant', 'owe', 'possible', 'explanation', 'like', 'burnout', 'simply', 'nature', 'years', 'university', 'journey', 'begun.', 'everyone', 'else', 'know', 'around', 'smart', 'disciplined', 'simply', 'cant', 'get', 'level.', 'hard', 'times', 'focusing', 'getting', 'motivation', 'even', 'know', 'weight', 'importance', 'task.', 'midterms', 'hard', 'time', 'convincing', 'study', 'longer', 'periods', 'time', 'hard', 'focus.', 'tell', 'wake', 'early', 'study', 'everything', 'but.', 'small', 'periods', 'high', 'motivation', 'study', 'multiple', 'hours', 'day', 'consider', 'win', 'never', 'days', 'even', 'weeks', 'later.', 'generally', 'study', 'everyday', 'tho', 'struggle', 'hard', 'conversation', 'others', 'obviously', 'people', 'smart', 'motivated', 'part', 'reason', 'got', 'here.', 'shame', 'first', 'year', 'school', 'begun', 'although', 'problem', 'life', 'feel', 'like', 'ive', 'enough', 'wakeup', 'calls', 'try', 'change.', 'really', 'question', 'ability', 'get', 'next', 'years', 'sometimes', 'consider', 'would', 'best', 'simply', 'quit', 'sunk', 'cost', 'hits', 'me.', 'anyone', 'advice', 'id', 'appreciate', 'im', 'getting', 'tired']",1,1,1,0

COMP250 Midterm grading scheme,"Just got my midterm results back for COMP250 and wanted to see if anyone else feels the grading scheme is a bit unfair. You can have a total score of 80 equivalent to an A on the exam, but if youre missing even a single Mastery point, your entire grade gets rounded down to Approaching Mastery, which corresponds to a B. For reference, I scored 1721 for Proficiency, 1618 for Approaching Mastery, and 1015 for Mastery. Im missing a single Mastery Point and get automatically pushed down into the lower category. On top of that, to get an A in the course, you need to achieve a minimum of 5 Masteries overall, meaning you have to hit Mastery on at least one midterm. So if you fall short by even one point, it makes it that much harder to get an A.

advice about letters of recommendation,"hi everyone! im finishing up my undergrad this semester  am starting to think about the future more seriously including potential grad school options for 2026. as im sure is common, my main programs of interest require 2 academic letters of recommendation.

i have a few profs in mind and id like to reach out asap, but was wondering if there is any specific etiquette in terms of timing my request i.e. is it appropriate to send out emails in the middle of the semester, or is it generally better to wait until classes have ended?

Lets talk about... ghosting,"Just this morning I spoke with a friend who was ghosted by a potential employer. My friend was feeling miserable. Since I myself was ghosted some time ago by a few companies, I decided to register my two cents here.

Unless youre being somehow harrassed by someone  in which case you should probably involve legal , ghosting is not an acceptable way to end any kind of relationship, be it professional or not. Not only is it childish and denotes cowardice, but it can have a severe impact on the person who is ghosted. That person is left without an explanation that would allow them to put the situation behind and move on. Its selfish because, while the employer feels some relief for no longer having to deal with their decision, they arent considering how the candidate will feel. Its also cruel because the employer gives no opportunity to the candidate to understand and improve from the situation.

The idea that its better to just disappear than to tell someone Weve decided to go in another direction or the like is only valid in the ghosters mind. The effects of ghosting are similar, to a certain point, to the ones in the process of loss and grief. The same way youd like to be able to say goodbye to a loved one before they pass away and many of us wont be able to do it, when you ghost someone you take away that persons opportunity to close this chapter of their life in a healthy way.

McGill is lonely,"Recently graduated and looking back at my time at McGill, I realize now that I didnt make as much of an effort to network or make new friends as I should have. Once youre out of university, it becomes much tougher to find the time or opportunities to form a strong social circle. If I could offer any advice, itd be to take advantage of social opportunities on campus, join clubs, go to events, and just strike up conversations whenever you can. The connections you make will be valuable both during your studies and long after you graduate.

The Security Situation is Putting It Lightly Despicable,"With the situation that I need not describe that has unfolded on campus as I think others have quite eloquently before me over the last few days, I find myself rather perplexed as to why the security detail that has essentially partitioned campus is still present in its current capacity, if protests have not only subsided, but a court injunction has been successfully filed against SPHR by the university.

Just this morning, not only was I refused entry to the Arts building as an Arts student, but I was almost not let out of Adams, after nearly getting into a shouting match with the guard keeping the door hermetically shut. I should also mention that I am a staff member who works in a position that grants me access to most campus buildings  including Arts. The same guard who let me in yesterday now forbade me from going inside whatsoever, because my ID card reads student and not staff. I dont know who, if anyone for that matter, is actually coordinating these guys who, after a glance at their jackets, appear to be working for either Sirco or Garda and if theyre just making up the rules as they go along  because they are acting in diametric opposition to what we, as both students and staff, are readily being told by upper administration.

That being said, a few points of order or of grievance

1 Reiterating the points made above, building access is arbitrarily restricted to certain buildings only. Arts is currently staff only, whereas McConnell, for example, appears to be not only open to all, but no security guard has been present in front of the entrance the few times that I have walked inside over the last 24 hours. This is doubly ironic, because as a nonEngineering student, I did not even have to show ID to get into the Engineering building, but, as I mentioned above, had to show ID to leave Adams  even though the buildings are, of course, linked via an indoor tunnel. In fact, I recently received a followup email from my department supervisor detailing the fact that Arts was closed to all students, as upper administration indicated otherwise in one of their recent emails. But why? Especially in the midst of midterms, I dont exactly see how this is productive or keeping the peace so to speak. In the midst of all of this, a fellow student, running late for an exam, tried to get into a building without ID, and was turned away. While I am a bit less sympathetic to this, given that all university mandated technically require ID in order to sit them and have for ages, Service Point, where one must go in the event of losing their ID card to retrieve a replacement, is also currently under keycard access only. Go figure that one out.

2 There are still fences up blocking certain parts of campus arbitrarily. While I understand that this is a matter of time before they come down, they are at the very least mildly inconveniencing, and are trying to court students away from highrisk areas, as I was told  whatever that means, especially given that half of campus is under construction, lol.

3 None of the security guards  nearly a dozen, if not more  I have encountered speak any English. I am a Montrealer, so this is not in as much a problem as it is for me as it would be for others at the university. Would you not think that McGill would have ensured that their outsourced security would be bilingual, at the very least, at an English university? This adds to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the security situation for many students and staff. Heres to the pquistes not coming after this point.

4 On the note of security being outsourced, security has been outsourced. We are a public university at least we are supposed to be. I do not see why or how McGill security cannot handle the job postOctober 7th internally, which is pretty pathetic. I understand the need, from the universitys perspective, to resort to the SPVM to dispel small groups of propertydamaging protestors, especially those who are from, in their words, outside the McGill community whose sole purpose was  lets face it  to damage property and wreck havoc. This small group of largely nonstudents has, in my view, and as another that user below me mentioned, lost the plot of the whole cause because of them, we now face ten days of an arguably charterviolating court injunction that restricts peaceful assembly that McGill at the height of midterms. I should of course mention that, the means partaken by the SPVM, were, objectively, and from the footage I saw, pretty horrifying. Festering this antagonism through outsourced security, albeit on a lesser violent level than police action, doesnt necessarily create an inviting environment, especially to upkeep the image that McGill so happily prides itself on instead it gives them bad press. Forgive the tangent, but I felt this necessary to state.

On that note, I surprise nobody by stating that everybody has felt extremely unsafe, and the university is only exacerbating the situation that they are trying to prevent. Convince your students who are running late to their midterm that being denied entry is going to foster a healthy learning environment, or, for that matter, that the riot squad spraying tear gas in front of the Redpath Library is going to encourage them to do well on their midterms, I dare you.",1728590256,129,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1g0rn9u/the_security_situation_is_putting_it_lightly/,22,alexroneill,1g0rn9u,10/10/2024 19:57,"['situation', 'need', 'describe',

Am I allowed to be annoyedis this okay?,"Im taking an elective right now and I also have a health related disability. I am registered with student accessibility and achievement. I got into this elective the last day of add drop, therefore missing three lectures. Additionally, I have missed one lecture due to health related issues. Because of my disability I am allowed occasional absences. 

This class has about 150 students, no lecture recordings, and slides without words. Also minimal readings. As soon as I joined the class, I tried to book office hours with the prof to discuss my barriers and also catching up on the classes I missed, however their booking system was broken. So, I followed up with an email. No response for a week. I then followed up after class, she told me to go to office hours. I went to her office hours, and she didnt show up until 15 mins before it ended, and there was a line of 15 people. I spoke to her but it was impersonal and rushed. She told me that she would grab notes from a student and send them to me, as she has done that in the past. Another week passes, radio silence. Our midterm based on these lectures is now in two weeks, and I only have mid notes from a couple students in the class. I follow up again with her after class, she tells me she completely forgot and will deal with it. She asks me to send a follow up email, so I did. SILENCE AGAIN. I went to office hours yesterday and asked what the update was. She told me that she asked a few students but they hadnt gotten back to her, and that she would follow up again with me later that night. Its now the day of the test and I have heard nothing. I have tried so hard to get help to prepare and she has offered me nothing. I 100 understand that I am in University but at the same time, she is my prof and I feel like should help me if I do not have material for reasons out of my control. Like I even offered to go over my notes or what I could make up for the missing lectures and she didnt have time to do that. What can I do in this situation? I have no idea how ill do on the test.

Can profs force you to stay into the exam period for an assessment not scheduled by the Exam Center?,"I am in a class in which in order to get the maximum grade on the final project, you have to complete a live interview scheduled in the period from Dec 16th to 20th. This interview must be in person. If you do not complete the interview you cannot get the maximum grade on the project.

These dates were not set by the Exam Center the professor set them in the syllabus. Moreover, it is not clear how or when the interviews will be scheduled it is unknown when we will be able to sign up for a timeslot, and we have no guarantee of getting an interview at a good time. This is actively preventing me from booking flights home and is therefore also costing me money.... I am done my exams long before Dec 16th. I want to go home, not sit around waiting to do a 15min interview that could just as easily be done over Zoom.

"Now that McGill has obtained an injuction against SPHR, hopefully life on campus will return to normal?","From McGill today

Dear members of the McGill community,

 

Today, the Quebec Superior Court issued a judgment granting an injunction against Students for Palestines Honour and Resistance SPHR and all those who become aware of the judgment. The provisional injunction will remain valid for 10 days.

 

McGill sought the injunction to protect its academic mission and to defend students and instructors right to learn and work in an environment that is safe, stable, and suitable for teaching, learning, and research. At the same time, McGill continues to affirm the right of all community members to protest lawfully and within the limits of todays judgment.

 

The judgment has the following effects 

 

SPHR and any person aware of the judgment must not block, obstruct, or hinder all or in part any entrance or exit to a building where McGill activities are underway, including buildings with McGill classes, labs, and offices.  The order extends to streets or walkways directly connected to entrances or exits.
SPHR and any person aware of this judgment must not engage in protest activities within 5 metres of any McGill building. 
SPHR and any person aware of this judgment must not engage in harassment or intimidating andor threatening behaviour involving any member of the McGill community or any visitor or contractor at McGill. 
SPHR and any person aware of this judgment must not engage in behaviour that disturbs the peace or engages in public disturbance, including disturbing classes or labs. 
 

The judgment also includes other provisions related to enforcement of the order.

 

The right to expression and assembly

 

McGill supports the rights of all community members to express their views through peaceful assembly, which includes demonstrations and protests. However, the Universitys mission statement clearly underlines the importance of offering the best possible education, by carrying out research and scholarly activities.  Balancing these values and objectives is critical.

 

We have been the site of obstructive protests barring students and instructors from accessing classrooms and buildings. Just yesterday, we saw acts of violence, vandalism and intimidation. In announcing its October 7 to 11 Week of Rage, SPHR stated that there must be no business or classes as usual. This clearly violates the fundamental academic rights of students, instructors, and all McGillians.

 

This injunction does not prevent anyone from exercising their rights to free speech and free assembly, on campus or elsewhere, within the limits imposed by the court.

 

The full text of the judgement is available here.

 

Sincerely,

 

Angela Campbell,

Deputy Provost Student Life and Learning

The issue with the protests,"Alright folks, feel free to educate me in the comments, but I just gotta get this off my chest. 
I believe there is a deep flaw within the protests, which is leading to them actually harming their cause more than they are benefiting it. 

As a third party student whose activities are being disturbed by the protests, I find it difficult to not side with the corporation that is McGill. As a queer, farleft, ACAB, eat the rich person, it really hurts me to do so, but the protests have given me no choice. 

Now let me explain my thought process upon hearing about the protests, I was immediately taken aback. I didnt quite understand the relation between McGill and Palestine. Education and curiosity is power tho, so I made sure to inquire with some of the protestors. The demands of divestment etc. albeit being a little naive imo, make some sense. I can understand that people dont want an educational institution investing in warfare. Now, with the current McGill situation, such a massive cut would be crippling to the university, and would obviously be turned around and further taken from the staff and TAs, with it having a negligible, if even tangible, change to the overall situation in Palestine. 

Which is where I find my issue. Why do I need to incquire to learn the protests motivations and demands. Any third party who isnt willing to go look into it themselves simply sees signs about freeing Palestine, with no relation to the university. No one is shooting people in the name of McGill, why are the protests even here right? Overall, there should be people with pickets and signs about McGill war profiteering if thats the target issue.
Take the law prof protests. Theyre out there waving their flags and pickets, and at an immediate glance you know 1. Who they are, 2. Who theyre protesting. 3. What they want. Having these as the forefront of your protest is vital if you want to get the people whos lives youre interrupting to rally to your cause. But picketing with signs saying free Palestine next to a university whos only financially linked to a company that financially profiting from a war caused by two other parties, doesnt really make sense to me. 

Obviously Im not mentioning other demands such as cutting off Israeli scholars and such, as that is obviously in the interests of the warmongers exclusively. And aside from it being frankly racist and judgemental, serves to limit education and progress. Only someone looking to seed hate would ask for the segregation of a people within education.

Anyway, thats my piece on it. The protests, although there is a spark of positive in their heart, has only caused harm to the cause, and the community due to the poor marketability and picketing of its members. 

TlDR
If I have to ask protesters who they are, what their demands are, and how the cause is even relevant to where theyre causing disturbances, then youre protesting wrong, sorry  This info should all be gleened from a glance at the protest. Not having this readily available simply pushes farleft people like me, the target audience, who wouldve supported the cause, against it.

Reading Group Interest?!,"Hello fellow readers!

So I know that there are a bunch of reading clubs at McGill, but I was thinking of maybe starting something a little different if theres interest. Instead of a club where everyone agrees on reading a book, I was thinking it could be really nice to have a platform where people can share what book theyre about to start reading, and see if anyone else is interested in joining them on the adventure!

Everyone has such different reading tastes, I feel like being pressured to read a certain book to fit in with the group can feel like a task. So I thought that a platform where we can find other people with similar interests without any pressure could be a really great way to meet new people. If others are interested in joining on reading the book youre starting, great! And if not, thats totally OK too. nooo pressureee

The reason I thought of this is because I love love love reading, but in all the reading groups Ive joined Ive never felt really interested in the books that were chosen by the group, so I simply didnt join. And while thats totally fine, I still feel that it would be nice to meet new people that love reading as well. Im sure Im not the only one to have experienced this 

So if this sounds like something youd be interested in, please let me know and Ill start a discord or whatever seems easiest for most!

Once inside you can choose to stay in Ferrier and access the 24 hour computer lab or go to the 3rd floor and access the Arts building, there is signs at every corner telling you where to go. From there youll need to scan in again with your keycard and then youll have unfettered access to the arts building.  

Hoping that the lockdown ends, but in the event it continues Ill post on how to access other buildings which are locked on campus.

"Does McGills insurance covers therapyconsultation or whatever related to insomniasleep issues? I really need some help and Im feeling lost, for real.","My question is literally what you can read in the title, Im an international and I have the typical insurance which I havent used so far but Ive heard its really good if you feel like it Im going to tell you my story now.

  
So Ive been sleeping badly since I was 12, during certain stages of my life, my sleep depravation was as wild as sleeping on average 3 hours a day during months.

  
Ive tried it all, trust me when I say that I have good habits when it comes to health as a whole and also sleep, I have a healthy diet, I work out, I expose myself to the sun as much as I can, no alcohol, no drugs etc.

  
Still, when my body decides that it doesnt want to sleep its over.

  
This is a fucking nightmare because affects my quality of life greatly, it sucks because I want to do things with my life but I cannot, during the weekdays I have enough energy to fulfill my basic tasks such as going to class, finish my homework, do groceries and keep my place clean. Other than that I do NOTHING because Im so tired that everything I can do is stay at home or go for a short walk.

I dont have much of a social life and the main reason is precisely this, I also have some hobbies and projects I cannot work on because when I have time, Im too tired to do anything.

  
Ive been in a dozen of doctors and no one takes me seriously, but now that I live in Canada I was wondering if I can find a good professional that can help me with this for once.

  
Anyways thats my story, sorry for the vent.

Difficulty in finding friends as Graduate Student,"Im a current graduate student and Ive been feeling a bit frustrated lately about how hard it is to make friends. I do have a few classmates I chat with, but its been tough to get anyone to hang out after class since most people just want to head home. The reality of Grad School is that its so hard to find friends who actually want to hang out outside of school.

Ive been trying to get involved by going to the specialized club for graduate student or hanging out at Thompson House, but I often end up feeling left out of the conversation or alone.

I was wondering if there are any schoolwide clubs or events that are active on weekends?

Rant about loud keyboards,"I HATE loud keyboards. And I dont necessarily mean loud typers, but loud keyboards.

Im just thinking of this because Im sitting next to someone who is a mild typer, but their keys are so loud that I can hear it though my noise canceling headphones with music on  It honestly just makes me so mad that Apple had the audacity and idiocracy to intentionally make a keyboard that they KNEW would be loud and then release it to the public. So now we are plagued by old macs that type SO loudly  Like its not even the typers fault, its just the model of their Mac. But it still makes me so mad especially when youre in the quiet floors of the library.

How do you view McGills reputation?,"Not that it really matters since were all here now anyways, but McGills reputation has such a wide spectrum like Ive never seen before. On one hand, people view it as the Harvard of Canada, the unofficial Canadian Ivy League, old money university, and of course, one of the best schools in the world I mean it is ranked 29th in the world which is pretty damn high. Whereas on the other hand, some people either find it to be very overrated putting it on par with some state schools in the US because of its high acceptance rate for its ranking, or have never even heard of it before. I also find that people especially in Europe, Middle EastNorth Africa and the US  especially the east coast  know about McGill and find it very prestigious especially because of its French influence in comparison to UofT for example, while in other parts of the world, the name doesnt carry as much weight. Personally, Ive seen both sides of the spectrum when I told people that I was going to McGill. I was either met with woaaaah McGill is such a good school you must be so smart or oh Ive never heard of it, why on Earth are you going all the way to Canada lmao.

I wonder how actual McGill students view their own schools reputation tho. I feel like for a lot of people, McGill was their top choice and many of their friends or the people that they know who also applied got rejected my case for example, while for others it wasnt at the top of their list but rather the best option that they hadcould go to. I could have gone to school in Europe which is much closer to where Im from, but here I am paying international tuition for McGills name lol obviously not the only reason but I was convinced mainly because of McGills international reputation.

Regardless, the people who know about McGill know how good it is, and I do think that McGill is worthy of the prestigious reputation that it has.

Is 6 courses in a semester suvivable for a student in honours,"Ok, so I just got fucked by my Cgep. Basically, they told us that calculus 3 taken in my Cgep could only be credited at Polytechnique Montral, but in fact it was not. I apparently got credited for math 222. Now Im registered in math 222, but I wont be getting any credits form it. I will obviously withdraw from the class, but now I only have 4 courses this semester which means I will have to take 6 courses in a semester at one point in my progression to get my 120 credits. 

My major is Honours mathematics and computer science and, for the moment, my 2 honours level courses are pretty intensive while still doable. I will then have to replace math 222 by another 3 credits for my major will not be able to take an easy elective which is going to be either 300 and above mathcomp course or another honours class in math.

The thing is, 6 courses of that level is going to be hard and I dont know if I will be able to get As with that load. 

Should I extend my major to 3.5 years or do you think its doable to take 6 courses in one semester, considering my major. What are the draw backs to doing a major in 3.5 years instead of 3? Note, I wish to do a master after my major.

dwindling mental health,"TW discussions of sucide

Note I havent gone to the ER as i am currently safe, and I know of the crisis lines available to me in case of an emergency.

i have my first counselling appointment at the wellness hub coming up this week, and ive been really unsure of how much of my sucidal thoughts i should disclose to the therapist. 

for context, i am pretty sure i have been depressed and sucidal for over a year, but it has worsened in the past few months, and in the past month especially. to make things short, i dont have any hope for the future, I cant seem to imagine myself still alive at the end of the semester and Ive been having recurrent panic attacks. while i know I should push myself to get help, I dont know if disclosing some of my thoughts might get me sent to the hospital im aware that hospitalization is pretty unlikely, but its still been stressing me out a lot.

Feeling old,"Am i the only one who feels hella old? Basically, Im 22 years old in U2 because I didnt really know what I wanted to do with my life at 1718 and then covid kinda messed up my 181920. So here I am, some gap year and change of career plan later and still have not gotten all figured out to be honest. And i know people say it doesnt matter what age you go back to school and that we are all getting an education all the same and I agree but I just feel like socially, making friends, getting involved in campus life and clubs when everyone is younger is hard. Like am i the problem for feeling like a dinosaur or do younger people find it actually weird to have a friend whos older? I cant even remember what I thought of 22 year olds when i was 1920 and it wasnt even that long ago. Like I want to network, get involved and build lasting connections with cool people but I cannot seem to shake off that feeling. I do try to put myself out there, like I did go to frosh and it was fun overall but nothing really came out of it because most of the froshies were 17 to 19 and I was even older than the frosh leaders.

Hygiene issue,"Hello, another not really scientific experiment.

I noticed a problem with hand washing only Men Labeled Washroom checked. Entering multiple toilets around campus including Macdonald Engineering, Mclennan library, Trottier and others, I counted, listened and calculated the time it took to wash hands. This could be because of the increase in density of Engineering students compared to other parts of campus where there are more arts students

The issue is the thoroughness of hand washing. After using the urinal or big boy toilet, around 50 of people wash their hands for less than 15 seconds, sometimes skipping the soap and just doing a quick rinse. Not to mention the number of people who just go straight for the exit 30 of urinal users.

So please, for your own safety not a threat make sure to wash your hands following the procedure you have surely learnt and seen before. Watersoaplather, between each finger, under your nails, back of your hands, palms...rinsedry

This lack of thoroughness can lead to the spreading of germs, sickness and disease.

What got you into a Grad program at McGill?,"Hey guys Im wondering if any of you who have been admitted to a grad program at McGill could share the gpa that you had in undergrad on a 4.0 scale that allowed you to be accepted into your program.

Im in a chem undergrad right now with about a 3.5 gpa and the minimum admissions gpa is 3.0 however I doubt the minimum is enough to be admitted so Im just curious as to what the usual average gpa is required to be accepted. Chem grad admissions are independent of the prof who may take you into their lab so i feel as though this might make it a bit more competitive. So especially if youre in chem let me know what made you a competitive applicant! Id still love to hear from other programs as to what made you competitive.

Wow I Love This Country Sometimes Im American,"Recently was left with a horrible wound for which I also cant get stitches for because of what caused it dont ask.

Because it is due to a medical complication it would be covered. It could take a year and a half to see someone but it would be free if you want to wait.

Helpadvice from neurodivergent ppl! ,"Hi!! I need some advice from fellow neurodivergent peers!

Recently diagnosed with ADHD, Im pretty sure I also have GAD, suspecting autismaspergers. Trying out meds, trying out therapists this semester, have an autism assessment coming up with autism md septnovwaitlist, have a part job 8hweek, variableflexible should decrease as semester goes on.

Im on sNRI Strattera right now, and about 6weeks in and currently on the verge of breaking the fatigue, reading material but feeling Im about to puke, headache, nausea, the inability to bring myself to study due to experiencing side effects, makes me unconfident I will be able to handle this given the things I have to juggle.

Ive been told this is not a very heavy courseload, its totally doable for a normal human being, but none of my advicers are facing the same situations as I amhaha. I potentially have to try out other meds, or have to continue dealing with these side effects that can potentially get better... Would any of you guys, faced in a similar situation be able to give me some advice on this? Is this doable given my situation?

Dental Insurance  Wisdom Teeth,"Hello,

I have a couple of questions since I do not fully understand how the dental insurance works. Im a Quebec citizen btw. 

1 Do you automatically get the insurance after paying for it, or do you have to take another step to sign up somewhere?

2 How do you pay the dentists by using the insurance? Do you just show them your ID or is there something else you have to do?

3 How much of the costs are covered? On the website it says about 80100, does that mean that I can go how many amounts of time and still get every visit covered with no limit? For additional context, Im trying to get my wisdom teeth removed, and I might have complications with them, so the cost must be very high.

Anyone else worked with Curtis?,"I wanted to share my experiences with an advisor, Curtis, and see if anyone else has had similar interactions.

Despite his awards being one of the best advisor of mcgill I never knew we had voting for these awards, Ive found interactions with him quite challenging. He often comes across as dismissive and unhelpful. Over the years, when I ask for advice or guidance, his responses are typically negative or indifferent one liners, suggesting that my concerns are not his problem. This attitude has made it difficult to get the support I need. 

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? Ive met a few PhDs that have him as an advisor and had a good time, but in person or online, hes been pretty dismissive in my experiences.
Well, most mcgill students figure it out themselves without advisors, likewise what I would probably do any advice would still be appreciated with an advisor who seems less helpful than a bot.

McGill Psychology Advisors CRITICALLY LACKING,"Id like to get an outside perspective on this topic. I feel like we have a critical lack of Psych advisors in McGill. Arts is by far the biggest department of the university, with Psychology being pretty big within the Arts faculty, with I believe well over 1000 students. 

Yet somehow, we only have 3 advisors in total, with one who is literally on leave right now. That leaves 2 advisors for the whole Psych student body. Is it just me or is that both crazy and insufficient? It makes planning my undergraduate path really difficult, especially at such a crucial stage of uni. I understand that appointments are scarce because we are so many, but as an academic setting IT SHOULDNT BE A PROBLEM SO MANY OF US HAVE TO DEAL WITH. Even when there were 3 last year, Id still have to wait a week or two for one singular timeslot that happened to be open spontaneously. Now, there are just no timeslot open at all for the semester.

How to cope with new appartment ,"Hello everyone 

So I moved out of rez and I now live in my own appartment. Everything was great at first, the units are renovated and theyre great, exactly what I was looking for. Then I got an upstairs neighbor and since then I havent been comfortable. Everytime they walk I can hear their footsteps so clearly. It makes the ceiling light shake which makes this very uncomfortable noise. Like I basically live with them at this point. I know when he eats, goes to sleep, wakes up. I can even hear their alarm in the morning. Its even worse when they have people over and they blast music. 


I just dont know how to cope. Im someone that likes a somewhat quiet environment, which was what was advertised when I rented this place.

gonna miss the start of school and possibly be a few weeks latewhat should I do?,"Hi everyone, Im a U0 international student from Asia. I started my visa application two and a half months ago, but it still hasnt been approved.IDK why its taking this long. We are literally  cash cows paying tuition fees several times higher than locals, Im confident this is entirely due to the inefficiency of the Canadian government because Im in faculty of art which has no risk of backgroundcheck, I have valid language test scores, all my documents are submitted in the right place, and Ive paid the full tuition and transferred the required amount to the Canadian bank its funny that it took them a month just to process this transfer. Ive also found an apartment near the school and already paid three months rent.starting from August so I already lost one months rent

So I wont be able to start school on time, but I expect my visa to come through within the next month.I sent a mandamus to the government hope it works The schools website mentions that being late by more than a week could have significant consequences and suggests deferring, but they dont specify what those consequences are. I really dont want to defer because Ive already rented a place and arranged for roommates, and a deferral is also gonna affect them.

Im looking for advice on what I should do. Im enrolled in basic courses for Computer Science, Math, Philosophy, and East Asian History. From the course sizes I saw when registering, these are all large lectures with over 200 students, so I assume they dont take attendance. I also dont know if the assignments might be available online so I can  complete them while waiting for my visa

The year is 2026,"The war for campus rages on. The SSMU VicePresident for War has recently signed a defense pact with the New Encampment Junta against Supreme Leader Saini. Multiple faculties now stand in ruins due to the constant shelling. After the March Rebellion, the entirety of the Law Faculty was exterminated by Sainist forces.

I head to campus for my morning lecture. At the first checkpoint, an armed guard scans my forearm  we all got a barcode tattooed on us last year. I wait 20 minutes at the border checkpoint for the secondary patdown and K9 check for bombs, trying to ignore the grad student loudly dying of tuberculosis in front of me. After the patdown, I then have to cross 4 more military checkpoints to make it to my lecture  how dehumanizing!

Armed guards stand at the front of the lecture hall ready to shoot the professor the second he makes an antiSainist comment. Today, only 2 suicide bombers interrupted the lecture, so I actually got to learn some material. After the lecture, I go to study at the library with my one friend gatherings of more than 2 were banned earlier this year. I walk past all of the empty shelves where nowcensored books once stood, not that anybody is allowed to check out books anymore.

Suddenly, we hear the air raid siren. The New Encampment Junta must be launching a new wave of rockets towards campus. We drop everything to run to the closest bomb shelter where the Cyberthque once was. Were stopped at the entrance of the shelter, another checkpoint. At this point, I think Ive heard Can I see your ID? more than any other sentence in my life.

Suddenly, an image flashes into my head  my ID, at the table in the library, left behind. The guard pushes me away from the bomb shelter. The bomb shelters are for McGill students and staff only, he yells. Defeated, I go to sit on the grass near where Rodick Gate once stood, as I watch the rockets streak through the sky.

opinions on new residence hall?,"i stayed here for my first year. immediately picked it when i saw the pictures because i was like woah, its basically a hotelvery modern dorm. in terms of facilities, theyre honestly great en suite, big room, TV, mini fridge, AC and heating, underground mall, dining hall, etc. i couldnt be more grateful to have had all of that for my firstyear dorm, its something ill cherish and remember for a long time. socially speaking tho? horrible at least for me. didnt meet a single person on my floor imagine living next to someone for 6 months and the only thing that you know about them is their name because its plastered on their door, very cliquey, no proper common areas for people to hang out or meet others, just overall very isolating. after all it is a HOTEL and i didnt do enough research about mcgill residences to realize that socializing in a hotel residence is super difficult. i did the honest mistake of picking new rez because my friends picked it and because it looked nice, ofcourse, with barely any prior or proper research beforehand.

because there were a few friend groups at new rez besides the frenchies as they always stick to each other, it makes you think that its a social residence when in reality most people kept to themseleves or were alone. it was pretty disappointing tbh. although i got to live the boujee dorm experience, i shouldnt have been paying 1.5k  780 dollars PER MONTH for a very isolating social experience...i know that new rez is one of the more popular residences at mcgill and that many people have had a positive experience there but this was my honest opinion after trying to love it for so long. i was genuinely so blindsided. i thought i was the problem because my friends abroadin other residences were becoming friends or meeting everyone on their floor EASILY and very soon into their uni experience, meanwhile i didnt experience that at all. i was genuinely so confused. after living there for 7 months i finally did proper research about new rez and all it took was a couple scrolls on reddit to find out that it is indeed one of the most isolating residences and i just never clocked it...

just like every residence, new rez also had like a council that would organize events and honestly they did a pretty good job. the events were unique and cute but the fact is not many people would attend those events. this is a huge issue at mcgill, many people dont go to certain events or societies except for academic ones or very few other ones because its seen as lame. im not going to lie, i didnt going to them either because i thought no one else would, but im not sure why this is the atmosphere at mcgill or new res or whatever. also floor fellows they wont exist next year honestly did nothing for me..i met mine like twice and that was all. at some point i forgot that she existed or lived on the same floor as us.

overall i am grateful to have experience new rez as a firstyear, and a few of the friends that i did meet through were from there but i honestly did not feel like i was a part of a community. i dont wanna seem like im complaining because all of my friends who werent in new rez genuinely thought that i was living in a paradise. i know that there are over 700 students so its expected to feel pretty isolating, but it was just so hard to meet new people and hangout with them unless you had a roommate or knew many people before arriving.

i cant pinpoint what the main issue was  maybe its the fact that theres so many people in one building, or that it has the layout of a hotel so naturally its not very communitylike or easy to meethangout with others, im not sure  but this was just my personal experience. grateful for it? absolutely, but i wouldnt suggest it to someone else or live there again personally. not to mention that park ave is literally the ghetto but its fine because canada is quite safe so i cant complain.

Trouble paying for essential medication,"I am a student from Ontario and I will be attending McGill this fall but I cant figure out how I will be affording my medication. Medical coverage is 80 and is in the form of a reimbursement. This is a problem for me as my family is low income less than 20,000 and my medication costs more than 1,000month. I do not believe I will have the necessary funds to even initially pay for my medication. So far it has been covered by OHIP but I dont know what to do now.

My idea is to find a pharmacy in Ontario close enough to Montreal that I can pick up my prescription once a month. But the problem is that a doctor licenced in Quebec cant send prescriptions to pharmacies outside of Quebec and doctor licenced in Ontario cant prescribe medication for someone living outside of Ontario. I contacted the McGill wellness hub about this and I was told that it would be possible to pick up my prescription in Ontario once a month if my doctor is licenced in both Quebec and Ontario.

These military checkpoints are dehumanizing.,"I had to show my ID card to someone about five times today so they can pull back a temporary metal fence so I can enter the DMZ that has become McGills lower campus.

I got stopped entering a building too quickly because we all had to scan our ID cards that I just had to show someone before entering a building.

This has got to stop. McGill has gone absolutely scorched earth on its students and employees for about a year. TAs, professors, students, all on strike at some point or another, the entire time negotiating in bad faith. The worst part of it is that they get away with it because of the Eternal September.

Its time to organize a tuition strike or something because there is a consistant and total disregard for the treatment of students and staff at McGill.",1721928524,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1ec0o3k/these_military_checkpoints_are_dehumanizing/,46,FtLilMermaid,1ec0o3k,7/25/2024 17:28,"['show', 'id', 'card', 'someone', 'five', 'times', 'today', 'pull', 'back', 'temporary', 'metal', 'fence', 'enter', 'dmz', 'become', 'mcgills', 'lower', 'campus.', 'got', 'stopped', 'entering', 'building', 'quickly', 'scan', 'id', 'cards', 'show', 'someone', 'entering', 'building.', 'got', 'stop.', 'mcgill', 'gone', 'absolutely', 'scorched', 'earth', 'students', 'employees', 'year.', 'tas', 'professors', 'students', 'strike', 'point', 'another', 'entire', 'time', 'negotiating', 'bad', 'faith.', 'worst', 'part', 'get', 'away', 'eternal', 'september.', 'time', 'organize', 'tuition', 'strike', 'something', 'consistant', 'total', 'disregard', 'treatment', 'students', 'staff', 'mcgill.']",1,0,0,0

Seeking participants for brain imaging study this summer!,"The Biosignals and Systems Analysis Lab at McGill is currently seeking healthy individuals, aged 1835, to participate in our ongoing study on interactions between brain imaging and physiology. Our principal investigator is Prof. Georgios D. Mitsis and we have received ethics approval from McGill for this study. If youre interested in helping us, heres some more information

What does participation entail?  
You would participate in between 13 scanning sessions, each lasting 12 hours, for which you would be compensated at the rate of approximately 25hr. The first is held at the McConnell Engineering building, on campus and is a screening session for the rest of the study. The second and third sessions are held at the Montreal General Hospital and include MRI scans.

Who can participate?  
Prospective participants must meet the following criteria

 Aged 1835
 No underlying medical conditions 
 Not claustrophobic 
 Not pregnant 
 No metallic fragments or implants in your body 
 If you have piercings or transdermal patches, you must be able to remove them during scans
 Head circumference no larger than 57 cm  

How do I know my head size?  
If you think your head size is slightly smaller than the average person, you are likely a good candidate for this study. This has nothing to do with your brain function, by the way  its purely so that you are comfortably able to fit some of our equipment for scans! We will also email you a guide to measuring your head size at home so you can doublecheck before our first session.

How do I get started or find out more?  
You can direct message this account to receive our email address for further communication. You can also find this email address directly in the poster for our study in the attached image. Feel free to circulate this poster to others whom you think may be interested, as well!

Will I get to see what my brain looks like?  
Participants who continue past the initial screening session the majority of participants do! will receive MRI scans during the subsequent sessions. We will be more than happy to show you what your brain looks like

IUD Insertion Resources,"I have researched many IUD insertion clinics in the Montreal area and would like to provide information in case it is helpful to someone else. 

I got a Copper IUD inserted this summer and only paid 14 in total including insertion and the IUD itself with no private employer health coverage through my parents, only my Ontario provincial health plan OHIP which I will discuss in more detail and OOP SSMU insurance.
I noticed many of the clinics on the McGill IUD insertion website httpswww.mcgill.cawellnesshubgetsupportfindcommunityresources were RAMQ only or had fees for non RAMQ patients so I wanted to help out my fellow international and OOP girlies.



IUD PRESCRIPTION

Can be done through your family doctor, a walk in clinic, or the wellness hub by a doctor OR nurse practitioner. This is where youll have a conversation to determine which IUD or other form of birth control is right for you. If you are considering getting the Copper IUD, I was told to get the Mona Lisa 5 Mini IUD as it is far smaller than the typical 5 year and 10 year IUD for young women who have not been pregnant. This makes insertion easier and reduces complication risks like perforation or embedding.

The wellness hub does not provide insertion services but can write a prescription.

An IUD can be prescribed by a pharmacist in BC so this is another good option if applicable!

Wellness Hub Phone 5143986017 MonFri 912, 130230

You will need to bring your IUD with you to the insertion appointment. It comes in a rigid cardboard envelope container so its relatively resilient and must stored in a cool, dark place. The IUD can still be inserted as long as the sterile bag hasnt been punctured and its not expired usually expires years later, but this would be determined by the healthcare provider during insertion.


OBTAINING THE IUD

I got the Mona Lisa 5 Mini Copper IUD which cost 110 in Ontario at a hospital pharmacy. I was reimbursed for 96 coverage receipt said 100 covered, the 14 might have been a dispensing fee. Most chain and hospital pharmacies carry IUDs but you can call your local pharmacy in advance to check availability.

Bonus info Planned Parenthood Toronto sells IUDs at steeply cheaper prices than typical pharmacies 44.50 for 5 year copper iud, 57.50 for 10 year Copper IUD httpsppt.on.cafactsheetscopperiud. If you are in the US I would also imagine it would be cheaper to get your IUD there if the upfront cost is a barrier to you.

Copper IUDs are 100 covered by OOP insurance as they are billed to the 250 yearly allowance for misc. costs for medical devices.
Hormonal IUDs are not covered this way, please call Desjardins to check reimbursement! I wasnt able to find the number I called unfortunately.


INSERTION

I have come across 2 clinics that are nonRAMQ and that provide anesthesia during insertion which was very important to me as this can be a highly painful procedure.

McGill insurance DOES NOT cover insertion fees at all and OHIP does not cover private medical fees 2 so ensure you are able to pay for this.

1. Clinic Medicale Femina non private medicine

Requires a Gonnorhea AND Chlamydia test since your most recent partner. More information in a separate section added below but this is either done by a vaginal swab during your appointment or can be done beforehand to waive the fees.

Insertion fee 150
Additional fee for GonnorheaChlamydia test during appointment did not ask as I had a recent test at the time I called them

General info httpswww.cliniquefemina.comenmakeanappointment

Make an appointment by phone 5148437904, MonFri 85 or on their online portal here httpscmfemina.portail.medfarsolutions.comenregister. New appointment times are updated every Tuesday at 5pm for the following 2 weeks, they appear to be booked within a few hours or so.

2. Cra Med ELNA Medicine Prive private clinic

Also requires a negative GonnorheaChlamydia test within the last 6 monthssince your most recent new partner.

380 insertion fee
99 admin fee
Additional STI test charge if done at the time of your appointment again, did not ask as I already had a recent negative test

General info
httpscreamed.caenwomenshealthiudcliniqmontreal

Call to make an appointment 15143451356, MonFri 830430. This is a private clinic so you can usually get in within a week. Costs a pretty penny if you dont have employer based private insurance through your parents, and always check that theirs covers private medicine. 


GONNORHEA AND CHLAMYDIA TESTING

Gonnorhea and chlamydia can cause dangerous infections after an IUD insertion so this is no joke! All sexually active individuals should get tested regularly but this is especially important for an IUD insertion.

These infections take 2 weeks after exposure to your most recent partner to become detectable on a test httpswww.actioncanadashr.orgsexualhealthhubstitestingtextChlamydia3A20You20can20test20after,repeat20test20after20320months and can be done through McGill Wellness Hub for no cost. The test involves a self collected vaginal swab and a throat swab by a nurse. These appointments are easy to get within a week since they dont involve a doctor.

I have used this service before and it was great. They have a no news is good news policy, meaning they dont call patients with negative test results but I would imagine they could provide proof if you explained it was necessary would be important to ask on the phone and at the time of your appointment.

Wellness Hub Phone 5143986017 MonFri 912, 130230

If you have a family doctor they can provide a requisition for GonnorheaChlamydia lab services usually a urine sample test and the results are sent to your doctor which can be sent to you. The largest labs in Canada are Dynacare and Lifelabs. I used dynacare to fulfill my STI test requirement for my insertion and was sent results from my doctor about a week later.
I cant speak on how these services are covered by insurance outside the wellness hub and wasnt able to find much useful info online but was just so that people are made aware of the alternative options. OHIP does fully cover STI testing but you will need to bill that separately as explained in the Insurance Billing Procedure section. 


INSURANCE BILLING PROCEDURE

McGill insurance does not bill directly so you will have to submit the claim separately through the website linked below. Ask for a prescription receipt when getting your IUD from the pharmacy and upload the receipt to the website after creating an account. 
To submit a claim, you will need to provide your Group  and Certificate  which are explained below.

You will need to provide banking information and once your claim is processed the money will be given by direct deposit. My claim took 2 business days to be processed.

Group  Q1103 all McGill Students, found on SSMU website
Certificate  your personal 10 digit student ID

httpswww.desjardins.comqceninsurancegroup.html?utmcampaignvanity2durlutmmediumvanityutmsourcedesjardinsassurancevieutmcontent2fplanmemberr1

Quebec is the only province in Canada where healthcare providers cant bill to OHIP directly so the insertion and GonnorheaChlamydia test lab fees will also have to be paid upfront and billed afterwards. I did not have my IUD inserted in Quebec so I unfortunately cannot give more details on how this is done.


INSERTION EXPERIENCE

I had my IUD inserted at Kingston General Hospital at the womens clinic which was a great experience and would highly recommend if youre from the area. The general phone number of the hospital is given below, your doctor will be directed by an operator to the clinic referral number 

613 5483232

You need a referral from a family doctor where they contact the clinic, then the clinic will call you to setup an appointment time and send a physical letter to the address you provide. This letter contains your appointment time and general info about IUDs as well as an intake form which can also be done at your appointment. 

I took 400mg of Advil and 1000mg of Tylenol 2 hours before my insertion as instructed. They offer ChlamydiaGonnorhea swabs during the appointment which is billed to OHIP directly as is the insertion fee as I was in Ontario. If you get an STI test in Ontario the results are uploaded to your OHIP account and the doctor can see these without the need to bring physical proof.

I was given cervical anesthesia injections 3 which felt about as painful as the COVID vaccine did. My cervix was then clamped to stabilize it and the sound plastic rod was inserted to measure my uterus which felt like a very odd poke in a place I had never felt before. Then, the IUD was inserted which I also barely felt sort of a full feeling in my cervix but was barely perceptible. After, the strings were cut and I went about my day. About 6 hours later I experienced moderate cramps similar to a period which disappeared after another 6 hours. I experienced moderate cramping the day after. I bled lightly and would recommend you wear a pad. Do not take a bath, have sex, or insert your fingerstampon inside for 24h after insertion.

I had a very easy insertion experience which I attribute to a the skill of my provider as it was a specialized clinic, b cervical anesthesia, and c the small size of the Mona Lisa IUD.

Everyone who works there is super nice and professional, from the hygienists to the front desk to the dentists.

am i the only one that found mcgill isolating ,"looking back i actually hated first year, it was the hardest and loneliest year of my life and i cant believe i put myself through that shitty ass experience. i cant even talk to anyone about it because everyone just assumes that someone like me could never experience what i went through trust me i was also surprised, but holy shit that was actually such a bad year for me...i learnt a lot and i eventually understood why i had to go through that year nothing bad specifically happened to me it was just such a static period of my life but would i ever want to relive it? absolutely NOT.

anyways, im an international student and so i have a lot of friends studying all over the world including my boyfriend, and just comparing their social experiences to mine made me feel so horrible and confused. either they had alot of events such as balls, dinners, etc where it was big enough where you could meet new people but also small enough where youre not just swarmed by hundreds of people like OAP  i know OAP isnt really meant for meeting new people, but im just giving examples of mcgill campus events that people ACTUALLY go to. or on the contrary, their classescampuses were pretty small so they would just become friends with peoplefamiliar faces that they would see everyday. idk how to describe it, they just NEW people, they had drama and actual things happening with the people around them, meanwhile i literally barely knew any people at mcgill besides the people that i already knew prior to coming here. it made me feel not only jealous, lonely, and so deprived of proper social interactions but also like i made the wrong decision by coming here

what would confuse me even more is that id see so many mcgill students having fun this was partially why i also chose to come to mcgill because i thought i would have a really fun student experience, but instead i was met with the complete opposite..

i will admit that i didnt put myself out there enough and that even when people would continuously reach out to me, i wouldnt always mirror the same effort. to be completely honest tho i genuinely had no clue on know how or where to meet new people that i could actually see myself being friends with. i know that things take time and i know that college is a huge jump from HS but i grew up in an environment where i knew everyone and everyone knew me, so mcgill was a HUGE a culture shock. everyone would tell me to join clubs etc but i always just assumed that i wouldnt meet anyone there because people would either join with people that they already knew, and tbh i just felt like i wouldnt find what i was looking for there.

i also assumed the same for my classeslectures because of how big they were i should have just gone frequently at least and seen for myself, but every time i would go to class id just get so much anxiety because i was always doing everything alone, walking to class alone, leaving alone, sitting alone. i literally remember feeling like i made the wrong choice of coming to mcgill after my first lecture because of how isolating it felt

maybe it was the residence that i was in i legit didnt know anyone on my floor, or the classes that i took, or because i didnt go to frosh, or because i didnt put myself out there enough, or maybe it was because i didnt join any clubs  i really dont know. but what i did know was that all of my friends in other universities were  in environments that were  just way more accommodating for meeting new people and making friends. and the thing is, im a relatively social person. ive never struggled with meeting new people or making friends until i came to mcgill because i just didnt know HOW. like i truly didnt know where tf to go or who to talk to to eventually find my people. i honestly felt like the university wasnt that helpful at least to me in providing a platform or multiple platforms to meet new people or create consistent friendships without it feeling too overwhelming. 

i guess that this is pretty expected for any bigcity university ive heard of the same experiences in nyc, london, etc and that its quite rare to find a tightknit community in any large city. maybe i need to be in a smaller city or town, but tbh montreal isnt even that big and its practically filled with students. in fact the mcgill ghetto literally feels like a college town, so i really dont know why i struggled so much lol

its genuinely not worth it to be spending 50k CAD yearly on a mcgill degree that i didnt really enjoy it at all social side  the academics were actually great when i could be going somewhere closer to home that has better weather dont get me started on the seasonal depression and a less isolating social life. i really did want to love mcgill, thats basically why i chose it besides the huge prestige factor that came along with it. whats funny is that my gut feeling was literally telling me not to come to mcgill before joining but i was so obsessed with going to a top university that i let it cloud my judgement. i know mcgill has so many niche perks academically and socially which is whats keeping me from potentially transferring, but im so scared that in second year id regret my decision of staying.

i dont exactly know why my mcgill experience was so isolating and lonely but i truthfully dont have it in me to live through that again. did anyone have a similar experience or in general felt like mcgill was pretty isolating for them?",1719079414,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1dm1l3g/am_i_the_only_one_that_found_mcgill_isolating/,54,Temporary_Success297,1dm1l3g,6/22/2024

Nothing in the email except for an attachment. When I googled what a .odt file is, I read it is being commonly used to spread malware. Antivirus software takes a look at it, sees it as a ziparchive and wont scan it as much as it would a .doc or pdf.

Please dont open it if you get this email or something similar. Just wanted to put it out there seeing as how university emails are getting a ton of it now.

Is this subreddit brigaded in PalestineIsrael related political topics?,"Like the topic says, Ive always had this question when I read discussions related to the PalestineIsrael issue on rmcgill. Here are the reasons compelling me to believe so

1. As a former McGill alumnus, I am now working at the intersection of computer science and AI. From the people I have interacted with and talked to e.g., at McGill and Mila, the support for the Palestinian cause appears to be genuine. Most researchers postdocs, grad students, and professors from various sectors across STEM I have known or talked to are supportive of the protesters and their encampment.
2. I also advise a few McGill undergraduates, and sometimes we hang out and chat about the PalestineIsrael issues. So far, I havent met a single student who is not in favor of the proPalestine protesters, at least in principle.
3. Also, on other subreddits like rmontreal, you can actually find a good number of Quebecois who are very vocal in their support of Palestinians. Of course, there are objections and arguments on that subreddit, but it seems the debate there is more nuanced and balanced than what we have here on rmcgill.

So, this leads us to the question Is rmcgill being brigaded by forces external to this university, and is it being used as a platform to antagonize our students and faculties support of the proPalestinian protesters and the encampment? If so, how should our moderator of this sub say, uThermidorien cuz I would trust his judgement implement rules to counter this infiltration if any?

P.S. I registered a throwaway account to protect my identity. Hope the mods understand.

Feeling deeply let down by the proPalestinian protestors,"I just want to say that I feel incredibly let down by the proPalestinian groups on campus. Im an Arab student here at McGill, so I practically grew up with this conflict and have been hearing about it my whole life. I have childhood friends who lost tens of family members in the past months. 

Im very proPalestine, but Im not in the camp of people who seem to dominate these campus shenanigans who think Israel should cease to exist. I dont agree with violence, and frankly I do condemn Hamas but I also condemn the Israeli government the quite terroristic tactics that the IDF has been engaged in. Given this, I find it really disheartening how the encampmentSPHRwhoever else is involved took a violent and radical turn in the recent weeks. I feel like all this does is turn people away from the proPalestine cause, and associate us arabs with violence and terrorists as if we arent already portrayed as terrorists here. 

I genuinely wish the encampment remained peaceful like in the start, as I think the popular sentiment was really in favour of them, and I think did much more for the pro Palestinian movement than the shitshow thats been happening now. Everyone was on board with how ridiculous deeps emails were about the encampment, as it was peaceful, but now thats not the case anymore. I just dont see why things like occupying James admin, that poster, disrupting grad photos, etc. were necessary. Like what were they thinking, how on earth would this help the proPalestine movement? A peaceful protest, explaining the proPalestine view, couldve kept a moral high ground, and might have convinced more people to care and support Palestinians. 

I also understand that this is a last resort for student groups, as a democratic vote was held, there was even a hunger strike, many protests, and the start of the encampment was peaceful, so Ive heard the argument that this is a move of desperation but I still maintain that this is not the right way. I guess Im posting as a rant, but also to show that there do exist proPalestine people on campus who really dislike what SPHRthe encampment has been up to. Can anyone else relate?

Police removed the protestors by force  Video below ,"Keep in mind, the protestors had barricaded themselves in a McGill building, and this didnt allow McGill employees to leave the building for some time as they had blocked nearly all exits. Hijacking a building with McGill emloyees inside, thats not protesting, its just criminal and violent. 


Edit
1. Side thought, this hijacking,the encampment have taken up so much police resources and attention that could have gone to actual people in need
2. McGill has tried to engage in talks with them, saying they would listen to them, encampment hasnt engaged in dialogue or any talks similar to students in other universities 
3. Grad had to be disrupted and moved, students have worked so hard for 34 years for that moment, deserved to have been on McGill grounds 
4. Blocked access to a McGill building one day, which disrupted all classes in that building 

If your not trying to engage in dialogue, and use borderline criminal and violent methods, there doesnt seem to be anything to gain. Draining police resources, hurting mcgills reputation with future students, and not even trying to negotiate

Is all of mcgill ghetto infested? ,"Is all of the McGill ghetto infested with bugsmice? Ive been searching for an apartment since December and every time Im THIS close to signing a lease, I search up the building, or company, and get handfuls of people saying to avoid the building due to the terrible management, lack of safety, infested bugs and mice, mold, not turning on heater in peak winter, and other illegal exploitative acts. 

I lived off campus about 25 mins away from campus during my first year and didnt enjoy taking the metro and not being able to stay late on campus especially because I love attending evening events on campus and enjoy coming back to my apartment in between classes. Im also a stem major who goes to office hours all the time, so I wanted to live very close to McGill this time, but it seems like the ghetto is simply another cash grab for vulnerable students that dont know any better. 
I just cannot believe Im willing to pay more than 1250 a month for a studio and the buildings are STILL infested with cockroaches and mice! 

Is there any part of the McGill ghetto that actually has good non infested buildings? 

Also, is there any neighbourhood or building at ALL that is walking distance to McGill but doesnt have the McGill neighbourhood reputation? Perhaps near guy Concordia, or is the situation devastating there too because its also for students? Or do I have to suck it up regarding metro and just live farther away again? I really dont want that commute again due to the amount I go back and forth.  Or should I just pay significantly more to live in better condition neighbourhoods like Golden Square Mile? 

Any experiences and advice would be appreciated.
 
Im also very sorry for people that got themselves stuck in infested apartment and exploitative management and landlords. Simply being students should not be an excuse to strip away the bare minimum standard of living.

Convocation and the Encampment  Some thoughts,"Hi, this is a throwaway account. Before I go on, I just want to make it clear that what I want to discuss is the encampment at McGill University, and their method to protesting during convocation week.

Just to first show my personal views on the topic  I am an ethnically Jewish person who supports the encampment, and has delivered supplies and have done what has been in my capacity to support the students in the encampment and their peaceful protest. I am not a Zionist nor do I believe the removal of all Jewish people from IsraelPalestine is the solution either I am not an extremist and I am a person who just wants the conflict to end, and I believe that a twostate solution is something we should work towards, and I have always believed this.

Now, what I want to talk about is how the encampment is choosing to protest during the convocation is incredibly ineffective and I think really damages their cause. I graduated in the Science convocation, during the convocation there were a couple students who wore keffiyeh as part of a personal protest. One student in particular, in what I think was quite tasteful, crossed the stage with a sign stating McGill funds genocide. The stadium roared in applause despite some booing, most if not all from what I saw in the graduating class applauded this person, and there was quite a bit of cheering. To my perspective its obvious that the student body as a majority has been supporting the position of the encampment and that is to have McGill remove its company holdings, in companies who profit from the conflict. The fact that majority of the student body supports the Palestinian cause, has been shown time and time again through voting, and protests on campus.

But then after convocation, after the beautiful ceremony, many get back to campus. And what starts is in a practical sense shaming the graduating class for being McGill students and for graduating. The speaker started off by saying Congratulations, but then went on to call all of our degrees tainted in blood. I dont recall all the exact words, but that sentiment of talking about how our accomplishment is not something to be proud of due to our institutions decisions went on. But a feeling I personally felt, and from whom I spoke too was shame, and from others anger and upset. Then this was followed up by taking over the Art Building stairs, and chanting.

Now, although I think this was very effective in being disruptive and protesting, I dont think it was at all effective in keeping support and educating about what is happening. In fact I think it actually harms the reputation of the encampment and confirms what the news and McGill admin perspective on the encampment.

First and foremost, why are we targeting the students and guilting them for an accomplishment. The issue at hand has to do with the institution, NOT with the student body. I think using harmful language and guilting people does not make the institution or administration feel like theyre in the wrong, youre just making the students feel bad, who made a decision to come here 3,4,5 years ago. Its picking the fight with the wrong people, the people who have demonstrated support for you time and time again.

Next, look there are a lot of parents in the crowd, and I think theres also probably a lot of important people, people who are in high positions of power who can make change or who maybe can do something about all of this. Telling them that their kid should not be proud of their accomplishment and then blocking off the iconic Art Building pictures, is just not a way to get those people on your side, to get them to support you. It again just drives them to maybe support the institution more.

Third, I cant imagine the feeling that PalestinianIsraeli students must be feeling, when they already have the conflict on their back of their minds at all times, and have all these hard pressures to deal with in life. They finally may have one day to have some hope, to be celebrating their accomplishments, and what they have done. That despite what they face day to day, they made it, they graduated, to then get told by their own crowd to not be proud of what they did? To be brought back down. Perhaps this is me projecting and nobody feels this way, but for me, thats heartbreaking. That people, on a day of celebrating them, get reminded of what is happening.

Finally, I think what drove me to write this was seeing people around go from being some of the loudest cheers at the convocation, when the student crossed the stage with the sign, to being people who were upset and angry with the protesting encampment. Turning against them.

Now, those are the reasons I think the method of protest during the convocation week has been having a negative impact on the perception of the encampment. I do think that protesting during convocation is important, it is a time when there are a lot of graduating students on campus, and their friends and family, who could be in potential places of power. Its a great moment to make your message heard.

But I think a way to more effectively take advantage of this crowd is to take on a stance of education and convince people who are not already supporting the encampment , that the encampment is indeed a peaceful protest run by students. Have protestors openly invite graduating student and their families to see the beautiful inside the encampment. Show the public, who does not support you, that this is a peaceful and beautiful place that is run and set up by students. Go around the crowd, engage with folks about the issue at hand and have meaningful conversations. Who knows, maybe youll end up talking to the right person, with the right power. Prove the doubters wrong. Thats this golden opportunity is what it should be used for, not getting people against you.

Other ideas off the top of my head, is to look for donations, have some cultural ceremonies on the field, and invite the public to join, take this as a beautiful day of celebrating the student accomplishments, taking away the power of the institution. How wonderful would it be, if graduates took pictures inside the encampment, or with the encampment, or participating in activities on the lower field all done by the encampment.

And I think thats harder to do and can be a more emotionally painful process then chanting and talking through a speaker, but I think its more effective, because its big fat middle finger to the administration, who keeps painting the encampment as a negative, that you are not a negative place on campus, but a place supports the student body who have been supporting you.

In the end, perhaps my perspective on all this is unique, and its only me that found the protests during the convocation day not to be the best way of getting a message across, but thats my opinion! Much love to everyone, I hope people will share their opinion and agree or disagree. And again I am really critiquing the McGill University encampment and their method of protest during convocation week, not about what they stand for, not the protestors, not the protest itself, not about the general political conflict, but about the method of protest. Hope comments remain civil!

I hope what I shared reaches the encampment, so the rest of the week can be more effective, then what occurred during the Science convocation day.",1717366936,277,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1d6p41u/convocation_and_the_encampment_some_thoughts/,37,Icy_Cow3523,1d6p41u,6/2/2024 22:22,"['hi', 'throwaway', 'account.', 'go', 'want',

 A friend of mine being blocked from registration to another COMP course despite having ALL the relevant prerequisites.

 All this delay in publishing the schedule and then MODIFYING IT AGAIN AT THE LAST MINUTE to create more schedule conflicts.

Advice for MATH223? Linear Algebra,"this will be my 2nd year at mcgill U1 and last year i took math 133, which was my first experience to linear algebra of any sort! i really enjoyed maths in h.s so i took the course  despite my major not being math  hoping that it would broaden my horizons on math apart from just calculus.  
along with the typical struggles of the first few months in a new city and environment, i had a really hard time grasping any of the content in the course. my prof was romain branchereau and i found his teaching style very difficult for someone with zero background in linear algebra i fully did not know of its existence before entering the course! and i struggled with taking in such new and complex information at our early lectures. i attended every tutorial and my TA was pretty unhelpful and i felt really dumb at times when i couldnt even understand the tiniest bits of the topics he would try to explain.

i got As in both calc 1 and 2 yet math 133 was my lowest mark of the year, i barely passed the final i remember flipping through it in the fieldhouse and just being so lost and the midterm was a struggle too even the webwork assignments tripped me up... and i felt very disappointed in myself as it seemed like to a lot of people the course was a cakewalk. i also know people that took it second semester where it was apparently much easier material??  
the reason i enjoy math a lot of the time is because after minutes or hours of painstaking confusion, you can problem solve to that aha moment where it all just becomes clear and its very satisfying! i just dont think i ever got to that point with linear algebra and it kind of felt like a little stain in my otherwise successful year...

after plenty of thought, i finally declared my major and decided to try out doing a minor in statistics because of how much i loved the stats courses i took in h.s and how i really enjoyed the other aspects of math at mcgill so far with calc 1 and 2! it also compliments my major pretty well for research in the future  
but i was quite disappointed to realize that in taking this, i would have to meet again with my foe, linear algebra in math 223... not only would i have to take it but i have to take it next semester as it is the only time that it really fits in my packed schedule which i dont hate terribly considering the content is still a little fresh in my mind, it just seems so soon...

so ive registered to take it next semester and the prof has not yet been declared so im really just taking a leap and hoping it works out. im not sure if theres a prof that usually teaches the course, but if i get the same prof i had with math 133, i fear the course would go similarly for me, if not only worse as the content gets harder and i lag behind.  
i really want to improve in the course this semester and honestly just figure it out. i still believe i enjoy mathematics despite how much lin alg has tainted it for me  theres just something thats blocking me from understanding this more conceptual type of math that i have yet to be able to identify!

so all this essay to say, any tips on surviving the course for someone who didnt really learn much to begin with in math 133? im planning to watch some youtube lessons of math 133 this summer to prepare in advance considering i assume we are supposed to be entering 223 with some sort of semblance on the subject meanwhile i feel like having taken the course and done all the work, i still know nothing about what linear algebra is. i was lucky to have a tutor last semester that i am hoping to perhaps reach out to again, as i found there were ways that my tutor described the material that my brain understood way better than my professor did.

tldr i am taking math 223 after really struggling with math 133 and am scared that history will repeat itself, any tips on how to survive or view linear algebra as a subject to someone not familiar with this style of math?

"Minerva screwed me over, need advice","Ive been trying to register for ecse 211 since Wednesday, but Minerva kept blocking me giving me a prerequisite and test score error. Ok, this happened before, because I never took comp 202, Ive done comp 208 which is equivalent but Minerva doesnt recognize. Ive gotten overrides for ecse 250 among other classes because of this.

However, I couldnt register for ecse 211 because of the error, I emailed undergrad ece yesterday morning about the error while 23 spots were left, and they hadnt answered me. This morning, I emailed them again seeing how 2 spots were left, and I needed an override fast. 

Then, naturally, they email me back a few hours later saying ecse 211 is full, please wait during the summer months for openings. So pretty much, because of a Minerva bug, I might be forced to enter a semester part time and delay my degree, completely unfair.

Review for the U2 courses, posted the year prior.httpswww.reddit.comrmcgillcomments13pwfy2u2physicsmathsandcomputersciencecourse

 Preface

This is the last edition of such reviews  Im graduating with a degree in joint honours physics and computer science, minor in maths. So, this is the review for the courses that I have taken in my U3 year.

I would structure this pretty similarly as before I will list off my course selection, comment on how the workload is, then give some review on each course, and also instructor if applicable. After that, I will wrap it up with a short commentary on the entire programme and degree. I will also talk a bit more about my favourite courses throughout the degree.

 Course selection

I took four classes in fall, and five classes in winter. The courses are

 Fall MATH 564 adv. real anal. 1 PHYS 559 adv. stat. mech. PHYS 352 hons. EM waves COMP 350 numerical computing.
 Winter MATH 455 hons. anal. 4 MATH 323 probability PHYS 514 general relativity COMP 302 prog. lang.  paradigms COMP 598 maths for ML.

As before, a very healthy mix of courses. Such is the perk for being in such a programme in the crossroads.

 Course load and a disclaimer

You should read the previous edition of my reviews, much of the commentary there remains true here. Im also a very bad student, meaning that I almost surely cram content before my exams  not a great habit. So, if you are the type of student that is constantly up your game and stay on top of things, you might find your experience easier.

 Course and instructor reviews

 Maths

 MATH 323 Probability

Taught by Nadarajah, Tharshanna Sajjad, Alia. Delivery purely online.

Impression

A introduction to probability of some sort. The first section of the class investigates the probability measure itself and its properties, whilst the rest of the class focuses on different distributions  where and how they are used, their different manifestations, etc.

Although this is a maths class for maths majors at least on the surface, this is not really too serious of a maths class. There are not really any proofs, the computations are elementary, and there isnt really all that much content being taught. MATH 356, the honours version, is an entirely different beast in comparison. I have not attended any lectures nor watched any recordings, reading the notes suffices for the assignments and exams. I would even go as far as saying that this is the easiest maths class for maths majors.

Assessments

This class has 4 assignments 1 was cancelled due to TA strike, a midterm, and a final in a 202555 or 20080 split. They are all online, and the questions are all quite trivial so long as you read the lecture notes. Since it is open book, you will have the notes with you during the online exam.

Instructors

I have not attended any lecture whatsoever, so I do not have an informed opinion. Some friends who took the class previously said the instructors were quite all right, though.


 MATH 455 Honours Analysis 4

Taught by Dimitry Jakobson. Delivery online midterm, else in person.

Impression

This is the last undergraduate analysis class, and I think it was taught a bit differently this year. From what I gathered, previous iterations of analysis 4 consist of a unit continuing measure theory from analysis 3, although I think this was barely being done this year. Instead, the course focused on three large themes topology, functional analysis, and Fourier analysis.

The material is, in my opinion, quite hard to grasp. We covered almost all the topological topics in RoydenFitzpatrick, before diving into functional analysis in R also in the same book, starting with Lp space theory. We continued into Hilbert space theory but with Stein and Papa Rudin as our textbook, then finally Fourier analysis  although no textbook this time.

In my opinion, the material is interesting if not a bit too dense. I would recommend one to stay of top of their readings. I did not do that and I paid dearly for it cramming.

Assessments

The class had 5 ? assignments, an online midterm, and an inperson final in a 203050 split. The assessments were really generous, in that all of them have many bonus points. The assignments and midterm had hard questions, but they were online takehome, so there was plenty of time to do them as well. Moreover, each of them was something like pick 5 questions from 8, and anything done in excess would still be graded as bonus.

The final was in person, but it has the same bonus structure. As a result, although I have questions where I blanked out, I made up by answering other questions. There was no cribsheet allowed though.

Instructor

Dima is an interesting prof. On the one hand, he is quite disorganised and his lectures have topics jumping around quite erratically, and not all his musings are examinable. On the other hand, he is very chill and approachable, and can actually explain things quite well. He also has a huge repertoire of jokes on disposal, which makes the lectures lighthearted. Since he is also a softie in terms of assessments, I would recommend him as an instructor if you are prepared to do some selfreading.


 MATH 564 Advanced Real Analysis 1
Taught by Anush Tserunyan. Delivery in person lectures, online midterm, hybrid final.

Impression

One of the best courses I have taken in McGill, and probably the best maths course I have taken. This year was the first year that they merged the tradition MATH 564  565 into one single class, and making 565 purely functional analysis. As a result, MATH 564 was basically a fullyear course on measure theory in abstract measure spaces, and also an intro to Lp spaces at the tail end of the course. In practical terms, MATH 564 and MATH 454 is mutually intelligible until maybe the end of the second week, after which MATH 564 covers the entirety of 454 in maybe half its run time, after which we cover the rest of the measure theory in Folland, our text.

The material was really really interesting, and the professor did a good job motivating it. We not only covered the theory of measures, but also introduced some of the immediate consequences of measure theory like probability theory. I would not pretend that the course is easy though, it is possibly one of the hardest, most rigorous classes you will take here in the maths department, and the difficulty is not fully reflected by the high average. The cohort and the professor gave the course its good average.

I know last year I said Im not great at analysis and I went on and did this, but given that I came out of this not regretting a single second of it, it should tell you how highly I think of this course.

Assessments

We had homework, online midterm, and hybrid final in a 303040 split. The most interesting part would probably be the hybrid final. Instead of letting us have cribsheets, the professor made the exam the following way she first accepted suggestions of final exam questions from students, then from those questions she selected a few, and together with some of her own questions she gave us a super set of the final exam questions about 24 hours before the exam. We then have those 24 hours to solve those questions quite difficult but fair, and then we walk into the exam closebook. In my opinion the format worked out really nicely we learnt a lot from those questions, and at the same time were assessed on them quite fairly.

We had 6 homeworks, all of which are quite long and difficult, and a lot of them cannot be stackexchanged since the prof wrote them. They were rewarding though. The online midterm was hard but fair, and given its online nature it wasnt hard to do okay.

Instructor

See previous years, but I will say something new about her. Anush really shines when teaching higher level courses in contexts that she is passionate about. In this class, she managed to gave us a lot of relevant examples in her research, as well as in areas that she has dabbled in previously. Moreover, the fact that she records her lectures and also provides electronic notes significantly aids our learning. I honestly think that I stuck through my maths minor because of her, since the three classes that I took with her have all been a great pleasure. Will definitely recommend.


 Physics
 PHYS 352 Honours Electromagnetic Waves
Taught by Bradley Siwick. Delivery entirely inperson.

Impressions

I will say it I really dislike E  M. Maybe someone who has masochistic tendencies around vector calculus would like it, but I really hate it. The course finishes Griffiths E  M after the content in 350 since we almost followed exactly the textbook progression, I would not repeat the topics that we had covered  just check the reference text. Sure, there are some parts that are a bit interesting for example, the discourse on the nature of light as a wave, but all the fun was bogged down by a slew of vector calculus mumbojumbo. Again, if you love vector calc, you would absolutely love this course.

Assessments

The assessments in this class are honestly a bit unfair, since there are so many of them. We have assignments, midterm, final project, and final exam in a 20202040 split. The assignments were very, very long, but since they are all Griffith questions you can probably find answers to almost all of them if you cannot finish them in time. The midterm was open book, and it was quite hard honestly. However, it wasnt very computationally intensive, so you dont have to be brilliant at calculus to do well.

The biggest problem of this course comes in the form of its final assessments. The final project, despite only taking 20 of our grade, requires us in groups of 3 to submit both a 10page final paper, as well as a 10minute presentation in class. For a normal course, this might be it for the final, but lo and behold we still have an actual final exam  and this time, its not open book. We are allowed a several page long cribsheet, but the questions were very computationally intensive and difficult unless you have done extensive practice over Griffith questions. The good thing was that the prof probably curved in the end.

Instructor

Siwick is not a mean person, thats for sure. He seems reasonably approachable, and is very nice in general. However, his lectures were often quite disorganised, and sometimes we encounter topics where he seemed uncertain about the content. I would personally avoid him as a professor  maybe his chemistry classes would be better.


 PHYS 514 General Relativity
Taught by Alexander Maloney. Delivery inperson.

Impressions

This is about as polar opposite of a course compared to PHYS 352 as humanly possible, in my opinion. In this class, we follow the topics of Carroll and gave a relatively rigorous treatment of general relativity, and the content of this class is just so nice. Throughout the class, it felt to me as if the secret of our universe slowly opened up in front of my eyes, and suddenly our cosmos isnt such a mysterious thing anymore. We started with a long but necessary introduction to differential geometry, before going into how the language of diff geo helps describe the geometry of curve spacetime in addition to flat Minkowski space. We touched on many classical topics of general relativity, such as how black holes behave, how gravitational lensing work, how GPS is affected by GR, etc. Since the professor has worked on theoretical cosmology and related fields for a long time, he was able to give us many unique insights about the subject.

In essence, I would recomment everyone  including maths students who are curious about how our universe behaves on a large scale  to take PHYS 514. Its truly a gem at McGill.

Assessments

Our class consists of entirely 11 homework assignments. The assignment questions were quite well written, and they complement the lecture content very well. However, they were quite challenging to complete alone, so it would be best if you have friends in the class to work on them together. For the last three assignments, we got to choose from a list of very interesting problems, which was a very fulfilling end to our course.

Instructor

Maloney is a brilliant prof. He has the rare skill of knowing exactly what to say to almost every question being raise in class, and he delivered the lectures in an extremely approachable manner. He was able to retain the students interest over the entire class period. Moreover, he also gave us many resources to study for the class, including his recordings and notes from the previous years. I would 100 recommend his classes.


 PHYS 559 Advanced Statistical Mechanics
Taught by Bill Coish. Delivery inperson.

Impression

This is a natural continuation of PHYS 362 stat mech. I will admit  I registered to this class only being very interested to one unit of it information theory, and so the fact that I didnt do too well is entirely my fault.

The course gave a very deep treatment of classical statistical mechanics we barely did anything quantum here. We started with a review of stat mech and thermodynamics from before, before diving into information theory, fluctuation about equilibrium, Ising theory, and finally renormalisation group theory. All very interesting topics if you are an aspiring solid statecondensed matter physicist.

Ill say now why I didnt like the class stat mech at this level is just so tedious. We sometimes would spend entire lectures working through the derivation of just one single equation, and as someone who enjoys rigorous maths, theres a bit too much handwaving going on to my taste. If you enjoy those though, the course is by no means taught badly, and it may be enjoyable to you.


Assessments

We had 4 assignments, midterm, and final in a 302050 split. The assignments were long and conceptually quite difficult, and since I was rather unmotivated I did not do well in them. The TAs are very helpful though. The midterm and final were similar and are both open book however, they were still appropriately difficult in spite of that, and the questions require some inspiration to take a crack it. One thing I do not like about the exams is that sometimes future marks are contingent upon previous problems, so if youre stuck early on, there might not be enough for you to go on in the following parts.

Instructor

Bill is a good lecturer. Since he works in the area of physics that he teaches, hes fairly passionate about the subject, and knows what he is talking about. He also provides handwritten notes on the courses that are quite all right the page references are all wrong though. I would recommend him if you like the subjects.


 Computer science
 COMP 302 Programming Languages and Paradigm
Taught by Jacob Errington. Delivery online quizzes, otherwise in person.

Impression

A rather unique CS course, where its not just focused on teaching a language or a theory, but rather a mixture of the two. This is a popular course so many reviews have been posted in the past, and I will be brief here. In my opinion, the hardest part about this course is the introduction of a rather novel way of thinking that is, the emphasis on functional programming. In this paradigm, every line of code needs to be rather deliberate, and a huge part of this course can be done in one or three liners. Once this way of thinking is mastered, the course itself becomes rather simple.

There are of course other things, such as programming language theory, and some proof techniques. For example, the last unit consists of a project where we essentially built our own programming language from scratch, using OCaml as our foundation. That part was a bit tedious, but overall the course is fun.

Another impression that I have about the course is that it is very well structured. Each lecture is well planned, and the professor larged adhered to the course plan. There are many support outside of class for selflearning as well, which is something that a value very much.


Assessments

We had 9 homeworks, a project done in pairs, 3 quizzes, 3 midterms, and a final, in 187153030 split. Quite a doozy. In practice, the assessments werent hard to manage, and the midterms and quizzes were good ways to keep us up to date on the course material, which makes the cramming time minimal during the final period. The homeworks have the highest concentration of one liner solutions that I talked about previously, so they require some thinking. The project was mostly tedious, but having a partner helps a lot. The quizzes were meant to be some sort of wake up call before the midterms, and they were quite difficult. Fortunately, the midterms conform rather well to the respective practice exams posted before them, so they were overall fair. The final was long, but it was divided into 3 sections corresponding to the sections of the class. This means that if the section sees a better final grade compared to the midterm grade, then your midterm weight for that section shifts to the final. This was a very good policy that made our exams a lot less stressful.


Instructor

Jake is also a very good instructor, although perhaps not for the same reason as the others. His charm doesnt come from his wild research stories or whatever, but from the fact that he is a genuinely caring instructor. He is very accessible outside of class, and he is always willing to answer questions. He is also of course a good lecturer. His teaching style is clear, and he is a very good programmer in functional programming. I would recommend his classes.


 COMP 350 Numerical Computing

Taught by XiaoWen Chang. Delivery inperson.

Impression

A mixed bag of a course. On the one hand, the content in this course is crucial to scientific computing on the other hand, its a bit too tedious for me, worrying about the nittygritty of numerical Taylor expansions or whatever. But overall, its fun enough.

We start the course with computer numbers, which has been addressed ad nauseam by that point in classes like 250, 206, and 273. Afterwards, we do a bit of an introduction of MATLAB, then cover the main themes of numerical differentiation, interpolation, approximation, and integration.

Although MATLAB is technically one of the course objectives, you dont actually need to program anything yourself. Every programming problem in the assignment can be done by directly repurposing the profs code. So really, this course is about numerical analysis, without the analysis part.

Assessments

We had 6 assignments, midterm, and final in a 202060 split. The assignments were straightforward by repurposing the profs code, and the theory questions were also quite easy. I genuinely do not remember what happened in the midterm. I recall that it was relatively straightforward, though. The final was long but also fair, and I had no complaints. I would advise to go to the review session before the exam since they go over the topics that are going to be covered on the final. The only thing I will note is that unlike many COMP courses where you are taught a language, you will not get any coding questions in this, not even pseudocode.

Instructor

I did not attend many lectures at all, so I cannot say much about Changs teaching. He does have a very peculiar accent though, and whilst some of my friends had no problem understanding him, I wasnt really able to do it without some effort.


 COMP 598 Maths for ML
Taught by Prakash Panangaden and Florence Clerc. Delivery inperson

I will not give a traditional review for this course, not because it is bad or not worth taking  on the contrary, the course offered many valuable insights in theoretical machine learning. I abstain from reviewing it because it might not be offered ever again, since Prakash is retiring, and Florence might not teach this course on her own.

If anyone had taken a course with Prakash before, you would understand how much of a gem he is in the computer science department, and he deserves to enjoy is retirement after the career that he has had.


 Course ranking

This is a new section that I havent done before. Essentially, I will divide the courses that I have taken into four sections extremely worth taking regardless of your major so long as you have the background, of course, worth taking, courses to avoid if possible, and runofthemill ones.

The two courses that I will unequivocally recommend both to physics students and to others, are PHYS 357 Honours Quantum 1, and PHYS 514 General Relativity. They are the courses that changed the way that I view our universe, and anyone with the background should given them a try. They are not bird courses, though.

The great courses I think are worth taking are MATH 235 Algebra 1 I suppose its MATH 245 Honours Algebra 1 now, MATH 254 Honours Analysis 1, MATH 564 Advanced Real Analysis 1, PHYS 251 Honours Classical Mechanics 1, PHYS 362 Statistical Mechanics, COMP 252 Honours Algorithms and Data Structures, COMP 302 Programming Languages and Paradigms, and COMP 551 Applied ML. I think they are worth taking if you are doing this programme, or are trying to do a minor in this discipline.

I will personally avoid PHYS 253 Thermal Physics if taught by Ryan and PHYS 350352 E  M.

The rest I think all average  not much pain and not many gains.

 Final thoughts on the programme

I thoroughly enjoyed my four years at McGill doing my programme study. The combination of classes that I took prepared me well for graduate level studies in at least subareas of physics, computer science, and mathematics, and I particularly liked the amount of flexbility that I have had during the degree. I had the opportunity of taking 500level classes in all three subject areas, without having to overtax myself too much.

I will warn you though, this has by no means been an easy journey  you are doing three of the most difficult subjects in science, and its going to take its toll. Whether its on your mental health, your social life, your personal time, or something else, its up to your personal work ethics and your passion in your studies. But from my personal experience, you will be able to get a good grade, have some degree of social life, juggle personal relationships, and obtain good research experience at the same time.

So go for it if you think its something you love! Remember, McGill makes it very easy for you to switch gears should you ever change your mind.",1717008240,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1d3jkk3/u3_physics_maths_and_cs_course_reviews_with_final/,3,barcastaff,1d3jkk3,5/29/2024 18:44,"['review', 'u', 'courses', 'posted',

rejection appeal,"Hi everyone!

It was the opportunity to live the life I always dreamed of for a reduced price tuition for French is 7000. I literally think about McGill every day since last year. My grades were above average and I still dont understand why they rejected me. My parents also talk a lot about it they were supposed to move to Montreal 10 years ago but couldnt because of family problems. I was accepted in April in Uoft but the tuition is 35k. Going there might prevent my 14yearold brother and 17yearold sister from attending an international university, and I dont want them to limit themselves because of me. In addition to having a hard time making a choice about my future, I cant stop thinking about this rejection. Therefore, I would like to know if there is a way to appeal or to be accepted.

Unsure if it was a mistake to not apply for convocation ,"Okay so first of all, I graduated during the Fall 2023 and I discovered that I was trans last December, so during my last final season. I didnt really met anyone during my undergrad as I live pretty far away from McGill and my disphoria prevented from wanting to interact with other people. Therefore, I wasnt too sure if I really wanted to go to the convocation since 1 I didnt really met anyone from my program and all my other friends in other program are not graduating this term 2 the thought of being awarded under a name I hate and crossing the stage during my early transition sounds depressing to me 3 None of my family members can show up.
However, even with all of these reasons, Im still unsure if it was a mistake not to apply, Im afraid to miss out on some big event. Therefore, I was wondering if some people who attended this ceremony in the past can tell me if it was a mistake not to apply or if its not that big of a deal.

Seeking guidance after unfair accusations of academic misconduct during final exam,"Hello everyone,

Im reaching out here for some advice and support regarding a recent incident that has left me feeling incredibly frustrated and unfairly treated by my university. Im currently in my fourth year, and Ive encountered a situation that has blindsided me.

To provide some context, during my first year, I was involved in an academic offense where I mistakenly copied one answer from a friend during a biology placement exam. I fully acknowledged my mistake, pleaded guilty during the meeting, and faced the consequences, which included being admonished and put on hold. While this incident was regrettable, it was my first offense, and it occurred before I even officially started university. Since then, I have been extremely cautious and diligent in upholding academic integrity.

However, recently, I found myself in another troubling situation. During the last 30 minutes of a final exam for my Economics Statistics course, an invigilator accused me of writing on my hand, which led to my grade being changed to NA on the university portal. I want to clarify that there was nothing written on my hand before exam, and I was wearing half sleeves, making it impossible to conceal anything. Additionally, there was a formula sheet provided with almost ALL formulas to be used in the exam, making any attempt to cheat unnecessary.

I found myself in a tense moment where I struggled to recall a specific formula, one which wasnt on the sheet. In an attempt to aid my memory, I momentarily considered writing the formula on my hand. However, I quickly realized that the formula was not even required for the solution I was working on, rendering my actions unnecessary. I understand it was stupid if me to use my hand instead of paper, however I didnt realise this then and I was really struggling to complete my exam. Suddenly, an invigilator called me out for writing in hand.

Despite my protests and explanations, the invigilator insisted on noting down what they believed I had written on my hand in the middle of an exam! I told them we could address this after the exam, but the interrogation wasted valuable time, and I barely completed the exam. The situation escalated further after the exam when I got into a heated argument with the invigilators about their handling of the situation.

The experience left me feeling harassed and unfairly targeted, especially considering that I had completed the majority of the exam before incident. And all this happened in the last 30 minutes of the exam, which wasted a significant chunk of time of me to complete my exam. Again, the exam was all MCQ.

Additionally, I want to highlight that I went to the washroom twice during the exam, but both times I was checked for unauthorized materials and nothing was foundno chits, no pen, whatever. I was wearing half sleeves, making it impossible to conceal anything, and no one raised any concerns during these checks. How did they not notice anything if it was written before the? I had nothing written while I went and when I returned.

In response to this unjust and stupid treatment simply for catching me writing something on my hand, I filed an official complaint with the supervising authorities and provided evidence to demonstrate that the alleged writing on my hand was not related to any answers on the economics final exam. However, as there were no followups or further communication on my profs end, I refrained from contacting him directly at that time.  I even allowed them to take a picture of what was on my hand after the exam to gather evidence of my innocence, but they informed me that my professor would contact me soon to discuss if the calculations on my hand constitute material that contends as cheating, which is not the case.

Im seeking advice on how to proceed and what actions I can take to ensure a fair resolution. Has anyone experienced a similar situation or have any insights into university policies regarding academic misconduct? Any guidance or support would be greatly appreciated as I navigate this difficult situation.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

 Dear McGill alumni, parents and friends

 I know that many of you have been watching the events unfolding on our downtown campus this week with much concern. I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on what my administration is doing to resolve the situation.

 The heartbreaking state of affairs in the Middle East that has led to the encampment on McGills campus is complex. I recognize that there are a wide range of positions on the subject and that there is a need for these perspectives to be heard. I also recognize the pain that people on all sides are feeling amid the human suffering caused by these events. I hear it in the conversations I have with people from across McGill and beyond, and it deeply pains me. I would like nothing better than for peace to prevail.

 As I have stated on several occasions since last fall, everyone has a right to protest and express their views in an appropriate manner and place, and I support the right of all members of the McGill community to do so on our campuses in ways that respect the law and conform to McGills policies and procedures.  

 An encampment on the Universitys property, including on its grounds, goes beyond those boundaries. That is why I decided earlier this week to request the assistance of the police, who have considerable expertise in deescalating and resolving situations such as these. We are closely collaborating with them, in full respect of the values we hold dear as an institution.

 The situation is complex and difficult. We are working diligently and in good faith with our stakeholders to ensure the health and safety of our community, while maintaining a respectful and inclusive campus environment that prioritizes our mission of teaching, learning, and research.

 I thank you for your support, and the trust you have placed in my administration.

 Sincerely,

 Deep Saini

 President and ViceChancellor

 McGill University

396 course,"I just received my grade for a Psych 396 research course , which I submitted my final research paper for two days ago.

I got no feedback until I checked Minerva and saw that I received a C, which is quite disappointing given the amount of effort I put into this project and the amount of time it took that distracted from my other classes.

Student Encampment McGill Admin Requests Police Assistance ,"Heres the message the McGill administration posted at 8am today  
Yesterday afternoon, McGill proceeded through all steps necessary in the protocols we use for demonstration. We informed participants that this encampment was not authorized and gave them time to gather their belongings and leave the premises. However, most have chosen to remain. As we worked through the steps, we also engaged in dialogue with representatives of McGill students.

As we have failed to reach a resolution, university leadership decided to take the final step in our protocol, and requested police assistance late afternoon yesterday.

Police representatives, who have expertise in skillfully resolving situations such as these, have now started their own process. We continue to work with them to resolve the matter.

We have been communicating with police since the outset of the encampment last Saturday. Throughout, our goal has been to ensure the security of all, including encampment participants. The police understand our values as an institution and our commitment to protecting free expression and assembly within the bounds protected by the law and our policies. The safety and wellbeing of all our students and staff is our paramount concern.

The ceremony is around the corner and I realized I dont have friends I can take pictures with.

I guess I have a responsibility there and could have tried harder to make connections, even though I was involved in clubs. Now, making friends will likely become harder. Probably gonna need to move back in with my parents soon, and spend days applying to jobs on LinkedIn in the hope of at least getting a rejection letter instead of getting ghosted, while I will like my connections announcement of getting a prestigious job or going to grad school. At least I am not entering McGill at the moment. The last couple of months were brutal. The whole university seems as stable as a house of cards ready to crumble.

Psyc 212 rant,"After that final, I gotta rant about this course. I find Gaskin to be the laziest lecturer Ive ever had and its not even funny and I took Econ 208 at some point in time . 

Because of other psyc classes, I put this on the backburner and only had a night to finish the last two chapters for this. And I was slightly worried I was gonna get burnt but like I predicted it was just poorly memorizing the terms from that mind numbing textbook. He literally ripped questions from other midterms and has the most uninspiring tests of all times. Everything is essentially just rote mmorisation. Like I dont feel rewarded for completing his midterms and sure Ill take a good mark but I cant say Ive really deeply processed anything in this class. He could make it so much more fun and exciting but instead everything is ripped from the textbook. Idk if its just me but some of those studies social touch and the ear mold for example are actually semi interesting like maybe we could dive into them a bit during the lectures. Or maybe we can see complementary work or stuff that isnt in the textbook but nope uninspiring slide after slide on stuff that you can just read and its practically word for word. 

Dont get me wrong I dont think hes a bad person or unpleasant like some profs but make the content more engaging please. I enjoy his tone and I find his clarity great but its bad when nobody shows up because they can just copy the textbook. Like if the textbook is everything why lecture? I know he has some recurring medical issues that hes mentioned and I hope those arent interfering with his ability to lecture but this course could be so much more than just a boring filler course even if perception is kinda something that we really only need to know and not think to much about in the future. I guess Im kinda asking for the course to be harder but come on like when you can eliminate the vast majority of multiple choice answers on first glance. 

Also no study guides and questions provided only because we were good that we had to validate ourselves. Come on now. I guess prof Sheldon set the bar too high and I guess its better than Dr. every question is obscure and is from the attraction chapterstill the lecture goat  Hehman. Thoughts?

 Review and delineate practices falling under the umbrella of doxxing within the McGill University context.
 Determine the occurrence and extent of doxxing and related practices within our community.
 Assess whether existing McGill policies adequately cover such behaviors.
 Recommend policy revisions or new policies to address gaps in coverage.
 Improve channels for confidential reporting of incidents of intimidation, harassment, doxxing, and discrimination on campus.

City making me sad?,"Does anyone else feel like being in a city makes them depressed? Im a u0 student and I was pretty excited about coming to McGill but now I kinda feel miserable. At home I was always at a constant of maybe a 710 or higher, with happy and sad moments in between. Ever since Ive gotten here, Im constantly at a 5 or 610 in general mood, and I have to actually do something to make me happy. Does anyone else feel like its super hard to find things that make them happy in a city? Im from a larger town, but we always had nature all around us and beautiful houses. I just feel like this environment is making me depressed and next year my apartment is still gonna be in the city near Concordia, so Ill be back to the hellscape that is Downtown  I love the mile end area but its just too far of a commute for me. Im considering transferring schools cuz of several reasons, but one of them is the fact that while the city is cool, its also absolutely destroying my mood. Does anyone else feel like this? If so, how did you get over it? Its just gotten to the point that I only have one significantly happy moment a week, usually when I go birdwatching  I have happy moments in general, but 95 of them take place in my room when Im alone and get to watch tv  These last four weeks Ive been busy and havent even had time to hang out or go somewhere I wanted Ive just been stuck going from my room to schulich the whole day and back for four weeks now and I just dont have enough time to do something that makes me fully happy  at home there were hundreds of little things that made me happy, like feeding the birds from my windowsill, or go seaglass hunting, or watching the cherry tree bloom from my window. At home I had so many hobbies that were lowcost or free, but here its like I have to have a whole day and take the metro to a museum and buy a 17 dollar ticket, etc, to just be satisfied for maybe four hours  Im not super cheap but I just wish there was more nature stuff around so I could do my hobbies  Ive checked out mont royal like twenty times and its just totally different from actually being in the woods and having acres of hiking trails to yourself  This totally turned into a rant but did any of you guys feel this way in your first year? Does the city environment make you sad too? What do yall do to help?  its literally working its way into my dreams  literally dreamt last night that I was in a beautiful and green old growth forest  also, does anyone have any time management tips? One of the biggest issues is just that I dont have enough time.

Dont like RateMyProfessor? Checkout mcgill.courses,"Hello peeps from rmcgill!

Id like to share a project a few friends and I have been working on for the past few months  mcgill.courseshttpsmcgill.coursesabout. Our project aim to help the course selection process of students, and avoid the process of jumping around RateMyProfessor trying to find relevant reviews when choosing courses and instructors, or switching between eCalendar and VSB endlessly.

We created a platform where students can

 View course descriptions schedules
 Rate and review courses
 Subscribe to new reviews on courses
 Check out how instructors are rated across different courses they taught
 A course dependency graph for each course to see what prerequisites the course needs, and what they lead to.

The website is completely free and opensourced. We do not charge for any of the services, nor do we plan on doing so. The website does not store your personal information, and uses authenticates Microsoft OAuth with your mail.mcgill.cahttpmail.mcgill.ca email to avoid review spamming. If you would like to view the source codes or report any bugs, check out our GitHub repositoryhttpsgithub.comterrormcgill.courses and our Discord serverhttpsdiscord.ggchCXAjdn.

The first batch of the reviews were scraped from RateMyProfessor so it doesnt look too empty, and all future reviews will be natively from mcgill.courseshttpsmcgill.courses. 

Huge credit to UW Flowhttpsuwflow.com from University of Waterloo, where we got this idea from.

"Didnt get an internship this summer CS, Rant and Future prospects","Hi, using a throwaway to not doxx myself.

I am a CSStatistics student and I didnt get an internship for this summer, despite applying to so many places. My resum is decent, but its not what I want to talk about.

Rant Paragraph Start

The problem is that to work in FAANG or other Silicon Valley firms, you need to be a fucking model citizen. Im talking that not only I need to be from a uni that has a good reputation which we are not toptier in CS, we are carried by the reputation of our uni in a general sense, but Waterloo folks have more clout than us in CS, but we need to rack up good internships, good projects not that hard if you pick the right classes and have excellent grades, some awards also help and research papers. Not only that, but you have to go and study for interviews like real exams except you have to compete against everyone else of the top of the class multiple times for a single company. Not to mention that all the good paying jobs are in the US  because Canada has been lagging behind for the past 10 years and we are treated like second class because we have to get a visa not to mention the rest of the world which has to get a more difficult visa. I made it to multiple rounds and am still waiting on some responses, but I would put my chance of getting an internship at around 25, which is very bleak. I recently learned the term httpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiNeijuan and I relate so much to the concept I feel like I am getting trapped in a more and more involuted job market just to get a decent job.

Rant Paragraph Over

Anyways, what I meant to ask was that am I cooked if dont get an internship on my last year I only have 2 semesters left after this one? I have a 3.61 gpa, did a statistical learning research internship last summer with a regular prof at a regular Canadian uni not McGill. Im currently finishing a fullyear exchange program at a prestigious Asian uni lets say NUS so I can remain anonymous. I have multiple projects from the equivalent of COMP 307 at that uni and a deep learning course I also took there a semesterlong project. I dont have any awards or hackathon prizes or anything. Apart from that next year Ill take more 500level classes.

Ive done my best to network recently, but it seems so futile for FAANG since so many people try to reach out to alumni for referrals there and the companies are so big and the interview process is so streamlined it feels futile for a referral since the problem is the leet code interview itself for the most part I do well in a facetoface interview where soft skills matter, but I completely failed my Amazon technical interview. I mostly reached out to smaller firms I went to oncampus events with and quant trading alumni.

Ideally, I wanted to apply to get a masters at Stanford, but I dont think Ill make it with my gpa and underperforming practical experience, so I planned to work at a quant trading firm I also like finance or a Silicon Valley firm a year or two using the networking I mentioned last paragraph to then get a masters at a good uni like Stanford, Berkley, NUS... to be able to get a more research focused AI job or quant trading research or something like that.

INCOMING STUDENTS AND COURSE REGISTRATION MEGATHREAD,"Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and were here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed. At this time of the year, about 50 of new posts are help me decide between McGill and X other university, I am still waiting for a decision, is this normal? or How is Y program at McGill?. You can ask these questions here and discuss with fellow applicants, incoming students and current mcgill students who want to opt in to answer questions.

Before you comment, please read the FAQs below, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to Service Pointhttpswww.mcgill.caservicepoint.

You might also try asking your question herehttpsask.mcgill.ca on the McGill website.

Which residence should I choose?

Here is a guide with pictures of the various residences.httpswww.mcgill.castudentshousingresidenceoptionsdowntownundergradTo know more about living in residence, you can consult last years residence handbookhttpswww.mcgill.castudentshousingfilesstudents.housingundergrad2023residencehandbook.pdf, or the residence comparison charthttpswww.mcgill.castudentshousingfilesstudents.housing2023residencecomparisonchart.pdf.

We invite you to have a look at the housing megathread for questions about housing in general.

What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?

We arent admissions officers, so we cant tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that in general, the higher you are above the minimum requirements for your program, the better your odds of acceptance. However, some students with perfect grades get admitted very late so there is a factor of luck. Applications are usually mostly processed by late Mayearly June, but can go into June a little bit, and transfers can go well into the summer.

If I dont meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, its a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

What if Im accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, youll be fine.

I was accepted recently. When can I register for courses?

In June. All the information is on this website.httpswww.mcgill.caacceptednextstepsregisterdates

What is this U0U1 thing? What am I?

McGill accepts students from different programs. students coming from CEGEP or IBadvanced credit programs have the background to tackle real university classes and complete their degrees in three years except engineering thats another thing entirely, whereas students coming from high school regular programs need to complete the foundation program which provides them sufficient background to tackle their regular program.

This website contains info for the arts facultyhttpswww.mcgill.caoasisstudentsnewfreshmanfoundationu0 but you can google similar info for other faculties.

Should I go to Frosh?

The short answer is that you dont have to attend frosh. However, it can be a way to meet people and make friends ahead of starting your classes. If you dont drink at all and dont enjoy partying, you may not enjoy your facultys frosh, but there are alternative options for frosh such as the outdoor froshhttpswww.mcgilloutdoorsclub.caoutdoorfrosh for outdoorsy people, or rad froshhttpsqpirgmcgill.orgradfrosh for more politically inclined people. Dont hesitate to ask around about different froshes.

Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?

Most of us havent attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably cant give you an informed opinion.

How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? Ive heard theres grade deflation.

Its hardMcGill will not hold your handbut its also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a classs grades down so that theres a certain average also known as grade deflation.

What is student life like?

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. Read through some past threadshttpswww.reddit.comrmcgillsearch?qstudentlifeflair3ASSMUrestrictsronsortrelevancetall to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen offcampus. There is a visible party culture, so if thats up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures sometimes as low as 30 C with wind chill, and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

If you want to know more about Montreal in general, rMontreal is a great resource.

Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speakor make an effort to learnun peu de franais. Also, if you plan on staying after your studies, its relatively unlikely you will be able to stay here permanently unless you learn French at some point.",1712855047,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1c1kaex/incoming_students_and_course_registration/,862,Thermidorien,1c1kaex,4/11/2024 17:04,"['hello', 'future', 'mcgillians!', 'know',

TA strike  final exam ,"I dont know about you guys, but I am fed up with McGills unaccountability. No matter what, they always get the best end of the stick and dont care about students. 

This current TA strike is clearly affecting the quality of our educationno more conferences, grades, emails.. etc. So McGill decides to do nothing  I just had a class where instead of an essay for the final, we now have to choose between a multiple choice final or having the grade of our past two midterms be worth 50 each, buuut you wont know the grade you got in the last one. Like seriously, this is literally a gable with my education and its impact. 

Its so funny how, for certain things, McGill gets to be a learning institution when it serves them but also a business when it does not.

Well, now they are not giving us what we pay for, and I dont think students should sit for it. Yes, TA strikes suck, but they are your doing, not ours  students are the customers, and we must ask of the school what we deserve and pay a lot for. 

Which is highquality education, and when shit hits the fan, AT LEAST accommodate your students with things like online exams or takehome or open book. Instead of resuming a whole semesters worth of learning into a lastminute multiple choice that can fail you, mess up your GPA

Unpopular Opinion TA pay increase is unnecessary,"I understand that this is clearly not the majority opinion, but I personally dont see a need to increase TA pay. TAs make roughly 33hr for a parttime job, which, frankly, is mindblowing considering the amount of actual work goes into being a TA.

Solar Eclipse at McGill with TSI,"The Trottier Space Institute along with the Department of Physics is organizing an Eclipse fair tomorrow, April 8th at Lower Field from 1 pm to 430 pm and we will be handing out free eclipse glasses to everyone! We also have lots of activities, including solar observing with solar telescopes, demos, handson activities. And children are also welcome. 

We have over 15000 pairs of glasses and we will be distributing them as long as stocks last. Capacity on the field is limited, so arriving before 230 pm is recommended. In case we run out of glasses, you can always go to Parc JeanDrapeau or the Science center. It is recommended that you always were a pair of ISO certified glasses while looking at the sun or it may cause permanent damage to your eyes. If you have any queries, volunteers yellow tshirts will be there to guide you.  

Remember that the partial Eclipse will begin around 215 pm and end at 430 pm. The totality will occur roughly around 326 pm which is when the Sun will be fully covered by the Moon. The totality will last for about a minute. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so you dont wanna miss this!  

Hope to see you all tomorrow!

New announcement from SSMU,"In a recent article on the SSMU website, Alexandre Ashkir, the President of SSMU, has announced a new permanent executive position for the 20242025 year. Tentatively named VP Defamation, Ashkir writes that he hopes the new position can address the growing workload of defaming McGill students. This is something that has been in the works for quite a while. So far we have only explored the surface of the possibilities of defamation, and we are really looking forwards for a VP Defamation to join the team next year to address the rapidlygrowing demand to be defamed. We at SSMU are really excited to uncover the full potential of both slander and libel.

The article outlines the role VP Defamation will serve as part of the executive team selecting targets for defamation, collaborating with student newspapers such as the McGill Daily to publish libelous statements, and allocating the funding for outofcourt settlements from club funds and other programs. Transferring these duties to the role of VP Defamation comes as a huge relief for the current VP Sustainability and Operations, Hassanatou Koulibaly. Having to do the usual workload of VP Sustainability and Operations along with our recent forays into defaming has been exhausting. It is a huge weight off of my shoulders to have someone come along and take over the defamation side of things, so that I can focus on the Sustainability of SSMU, and maybe even doing an Operation. The whole executive council feels the same way  we hope that the new position will allow SSMU to operate much more efficiently and to deliver to the student body some longoverdue defamation.

According to the SSMU website, selfnominations to be the first VP Defamation are now open. If you are someone who really enjoys spreading falsehoods, conspiring to ruin someones character, or misappropriating student funds, this role is for you. No prior experience is necessary, although proficiency in cyberbullying will prove useful. So far, the polling for next years VP Defamation is quite tight, with Audrey Durandale at 53.9 and None at 46.1.

why cant we take dining hall food outside of the dining hall,"i honestly find it absurd that im paying 6k for this food yet im restricted to eat it in the dining hall and in the dining hall onlyfirstly it closes at 9pm and idk about yall but i get cravings at like 12am. i have spent an insane amount of money on doordash this year and i thought that id be able to resolve it if i could get the food from the dining hall and eat it in my dorm or wherever, but theyre so strict about it. sometimes im in a rush or cant dedicate a certain amount of time to sit and eat in the dining hall, and i personally like to enjoy eating my food which includes not having to rush while im eating, but also being able to watch netflix etc etc. 

idk i just find it weird, like im paying for this food why cant i eat it wherever i want. i know some people as well who dont like eating in the dining hall at all because it can feel pretty overwhelming, especially during dinner.

also, apparently they used to be super flexible about this before so i wonder what caused the rule to change. if there was a valid reason then maybe id understand it but i truly dont get why its such a big deal

Booking Rooms on Campus,"So uhhhh, one of my clubs runs events twice a week in the SSMU building. And with just 2 days notice before our next event, SSMU cancelled all our bookings in the building for the next 2 weeks. They did not specify why bookings were cancelled beyond them planning some broader initiative.

So now we have little choice but to try and book a room in another building on campus. Does anyone have experience with doing this? Ive never booked outside of the SSMU building before.

From what I gather, I need to go fill out the form listed on the SHHS websitehttpswww.mcgill.caeventsbookingsapplystudents and then wait for them to get back to me. But the form implies that it costs money for a student club to book a room. Wed just need a classroom with a projector system and enough seating for 2025 people  no alcohol or food or anything. I know the McGill Debating Union books multiple rooms in the Sherbrooke building twice a week. But Ive never heard anyone in the club talk about that costing them anything.

Does anyone know what the costs of say, booking a room for 2 hours in 680688 Sherbrooke for a student club would be? With SSMU being completely broke, I dont think I could apply for funding from them to cover the room booking costs if there are any. But welp.

A McGillians Guide to Brewing Cider at Home or in your dorm,"Why? Gerts is expensive, the BDA line is too long, and I spend enough money on groceries so why dont you just make your own cider at home. Also its more fun to write this then study for my finals.

Who? Its a secret and if you know me no you dont.

How? Lets get into it.

First, I will show you my process as I make my next batch then I will explain how you will be able to do it with minimal equipment.

Overview

All it takes to make alcohol is sugar, water, yeast, and time. Water acts as a medium to support and activate your yeast. The sugar is the yeasts food where yeast will eat the sugar then puke out alcohol and carbon dioxide as byproducts. This is the fermentation process. To make sure that you are maximizing your alcohol content you need to give it time for the yeast to eat all of the sugar. I have never had a batch take longer than two weeks, but you know when the yeast is finished when they stop releasing gasses  more on this later.

My process 

Gathering materials 

While making alcohol only takes sugar, water and yeast making it taste good means you have to be more selective with your ingredients. I use PC apple drink for my budget batches not bad honestly and nicer real apple juice for all my other batches. Today I am using 12 liters of oasis apple juice and 8 liters of del monte peach juice to give this batch a nice flavor and theyre both currently 99c a liter at provigo. The juice you use is entirely up to you as long as you dont have preservatives in there. Preservatives will harm or kill your yeast and might ruin your batch. It is possible for your yeast to fight through the preservatives, but it is best to not include them at all.

Complete list

Buckets I use plastic Canadian tire buckets because they are cheap. It is important to use the right form of plastic to ferment in otherwise it causes cancer But this depends on which government health agency you trust

StarSan  a special sanitizer made for homebrewing.

Assorted measuring cups  I like the pretend I am a scientist, so I keep notes on the amounts I add.

Airlock  Is it haphazardly glued into the top of this lid? Yes, next question.

Hydrometer  used to estimate my alcohol percentage. Unnecessary but nice to have.

EC1118 Yeast  A trooper of a yeast made to ferment wine and mead but strong enough to ferment anything. You can use any type of yeast including some bread yeasts, but I will not guarantee the results. Also, using bread yeast is trashy.  

Yeast nutrients  keeps my yeast happy.

Pectic enzymes  Improves clarity of my batches for purely aesthetic reasons.

Juice  To provide sugar and a base.

Sugar  gives the yeast more food making a stronger batch.

Splenda  what I am experimenting with now. By providing a form of sweetener that the yeast cannot eat I should theoretically be able to produce batches of sweet cider. It worked well last time I just want to get my ratios down.

Sanitizing

The next step is sanitizing. This is the most involved step of the process. You cannot use soap and hot water to sanitize instead use special sanitizer on all of your tools. I use StarSan and I highly recommend it to everyone. Everything that touches your batch must be sanitized in my case that is my hydrometer, buckets, spoons, measuring cups, and airlock. If you dont sanitize then you run the risk of letting in bad bacteria. This will ruin your batches and make you sad.

NOTE if you are following my instructions for the minimal equipment batch you dont need to sanitize. More on this later.

Adding ingredients

Start with activating your yeast. Follow the instructions on the back of the package and make sure your water isnt too hot or youll kill your yeast.

Then add ingredients as recommended by the packages. In this case I use 1 package of yeast, 1teaspoon yeast nutrient, 3 teaspoon Pectic Enzyme, 1 cup of brown sugar, and 35 grams of Splenda. Then I add all my juice and get a reading with my hydrometer. I will have to confirm at the end, but this batch should be 6 alcohol.

Airlock

It is important to add an airlock to your batch. If you leave it exposed to air it will turn to vinegar. It is the same process as if you leave a bottle of wine out. If you fully seal it into an airtight container then you will create a bomb. The gasses released by the yeast will expand your container and eventually explode. A simple airlock will allow the oxygen to be pushed out and for it to be protected by a friendly layer of gasses.

Waiting

Now you need patience. You have to wait until your airlock stops bubbling. If there are no more gasses being released then the yeast have eaten all the sugar and they have begun hibernating again. In my experience, it shouldnt take more than two weeks but if you add real fruit mash in there it could take longer. I normally give it a shake at around the oneweek mark. Some people swear it improves flavor others think it puts your batches at risk  I havent experimented enough to have an opinion. I shake it just in case at this point.

Thats it. In 2 weeks, I will have around 20 liters of cider. I bottle them in old wine and alcohol bottles to make them easier to store and transport. I will make another post of my bottling process in 2 weeks.



Budget way to do it

Thank you for reading through my guide. Now you get the budget way to do it. Most of my equipment is so I can make batches at scale and with some level of consistency and science. If all you want is to make cider the easiest way possible you have options.

Equipment.

Rubber bands

Balloons

Yeast

Juice

Sugar optional

 

In this process we will skip the sanitizing procedures. We can assume that the containers the juice come in are sanitary. Then we use rubber bands and balloons as an airlock and ferment them in the container that the juice comes in.

Buy juice again being careful to avoid preservatives. Juice can have a very loose definition here. Your goal is some sugar and water mixture. I had a friend ferment Gatorade and I would not recommend but it works. I would advise sticking to things resembling juice as much as possible. Buy larger bottles as you will get the most bang for your buck. 

Activate your yeast.

Note  if you would like you can use bread yeast. It might affect the flavor and also come on now.

Pour yeast directly into the juice container.

Do not recap the top but instead attach the balloon to the top and use rubber bands to secure it on.

Follow the same waiting process as above.

You can Burp your brew. If your balloon seems like its too full you can remove it to deflate it, then reattach. Best to do this partway through the process if at all to ensure that there are still gasses to push away any oxygen that enters. 

Thats it. Thats all it takes. Once youre done share it with friends or drink it alone to get the courage to post your crushes on spotted McGill.

I failed my entire first semester at McGill. Is eflagging possible in my situation?,"In Fall 2021, I entered the first semester of my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with 4 courses. At that time, I felt very ready to tackle university as I had a pretty good idea on what college classes required with completing CEGEP.

However, it was around this time that my mom revealed to me that my dad had been cheating on her for the past year. It came as a complete shock to me, and devastated her. The following months could only be described as the worst of my life. My mom, who had been an emotional wreck, started drinking and fighting with my dad constantly. My dad, who always had very intense anger issues, would yell at her back 10 fold and never apologized. Although he stopped the affair, they were both extremely emotionally, psychologically, verbally, and physically abusive to each other. They regularly hit each other, slapped each other, broke plates,  slammed doors, and more. All in my presence. They were always somewhat abusive to each other as I grew up, but it was never this bad.

I remember one night where I was up in my room trying to study, and my mom screamed at me to come down and help her because my dad was trying to get into their bedroom to fight with her again and she was trying to lock him out. I had to physically restrain my dad so they wouldnt get physical again. He slapped me in the face, called me a bitch and said I was no longer his daughter. I cried very hard. He stormed out of the house and only came back the next night. At that point, I became an emotional punching bag for their troubles.

Starting from October, I lost all motivation to study. Coming home every evening was terrifying to me because I knew what awaited me. To add to that, I experienced a lot of loneliness because I wasnt able to form any friendships at McGill. I stopped showing up to classes, I slept a lot, didnt eat, and didnt shower. I felt like life wasnt worth living. I attempted to take my life twice. 

I didnt show up to my finals, which got me the letter J in all my classes on my transcript. I officially had a 0.00 Cumulative GPA.

This was 3 years ago. After some time reflecting and talking with a childhood friend about my troubles, I managed to get back up and start studying again. Since then, I maintained around a 3.15 GPA for every semester, and I only have 1 semester left to do. However, my Cumulative GPA right now is 2.62

I feel very burdened by that first semester and wish I could just erase it from my transcript as it doesnt truly represent all my efforts at McGill. I really want to get into grad school, but all university requires a minimum of 3.0 GPA. I read a lot about eflagging and how it may be helpful to fix my CGPA. However, I read on the McGill site that supporting documentation is required for consideration. I never consulted a psychologist I didnt have enough money back then so I dont have any diagnosis to show. I did hear that for arts student, they give eflags more easily, but I wonder if its just a rumor. Please, does anyone know or have experience about eflagging and whether I could be considered? Thank you.

Any international grad students who are parentsmoms willing to talk to me? ,"Hi everyone,
I know there is a lot going on at McGill at the moment with the TA strike. I want to start by saying that I am very much in support of the strike and hope negotiations go the unions way. However, I only have about a week left to decide whether I want to commit to McGill versus another university for a PhD program in a social science, so I am hoping to hear from current international grad students if at all possible. 

My situation I am a woman in my late 20s and I am from the US. I have tried to get a sense of how possible it would be to have a baby as an international grad student and the primary visa holder  although my husband will be applying for an OWP if we come to Montral whose French is not fluent, but I havent come up with solid answers. Now, I assume because of the strike, I havent had any luck getting ahold of people in my department to specifically ask them about this. I am really excited about the program and the research I could do at McGill, but unfortunately I am not willing to wait until after I finish a PhD in 5 years to start a family. For even more context, our plan would be to wait until I am ABD to start trying, but who knows how long it might even takeif I could even get pregnant while still in school. 

Are there any grad students with kids, particularly international ones, who would be willing to please talk to me about your experience as a parenting student at McGill? Even better if you are a woman and had a baby while in grad school there, but I would love to hear from anyone who is willing to share. And please feel free to DM me if you are comfortable with that. Thank you so much in advance! I really appreciate your input as I decide whether or not to attend McGill in the fall.

WASTING MY LIFE AT MCGILL!,"McGill has me so disappointed during my time here.

x200B

Before I start sharing my thoughts, I just wanna give a headsup,! I like complaining about things that are unfair from my perspective, and these are just my personal opinions.! !This is gonna be a long post so skip if you dont wanna hear me complainingshare my views on the school.Some of you may have an amazing experience at McGill but I am certainly not one of you! Please dont judge if you feel like I am biased, keep the conversation respectful and peaceful.! ! Also I am not a native English speaker, dont mind if there are mistakes or weird expressions.!

x200B

I came to McGill during covid period, in Fall 2021. I entered U1 in Software Eng Coop, the first year this program was created and it was a complete chaos. We had 2 coop advisors at the beginning, and we had an orientation session where everyone in the program got a chance to meet each other on zoom. It had me felt excited to start my life at McGill and maybe get a couple of internships during my studies, make some new friends, explore some activities in the school etc.

The second month after school started, my view completely shifted. I was sending an email to one of our coop advisors  I will keep the person anonymous and I got an automatic reply saying the person no longer works at McGill and guess what the person went to work in Concordia, probably for a better compensation or better environment I guess I am not sure. 

And Daniel Varro, who was the program coordinator, I dont remember when, probably fall 2023 or winter 2023, left McGill too. Well he became an adjunct professor heresomeone who is still affiliated with the school but no longer teaches here. Apparently, if you are not physically at McGill, you cant really manage the program, so after a semester, the role was taken by Frank Ferrie, for those of you in ECSE, I believe everyone knows him. 

In addition to this, after one of our coop advisor left, we got another advisor assigned to our program after a semester or so, who stayed in this role for only 1 semester and moved to a different role at McGill. After this we only had one coop advisor for nearly 100 ppl in the same year. more ppl came in the following years In recent months, I believe this program hired a new advisor, the same advisor stayed all the way from beginning was working parttime and had to handle hundreds of ppl alone. I honestly feel sorry for this person and I would say my experience with these advisors was mainly positive, at least they are doing their job and tried their best to help us. Interacting with them was the !only time !I felt I was being cared at McGill. I will keep their names hidden, cuz I dont think my negative experience has to do with them.

!That was all the chaos happened with the coop program, frequent change to the management memebers. That explains why this program was a total failure. I honestly do not understand the point of creating this software eng coop program. The coop part does not even exist, Ill explain!

1. The program has zero industrial connection or partnership with any company or corporation, at least I dont recall any. There are some networking event in ECC, but those already exist outside of the coop program.
2. All the cv building, cover letter workshop, networking workshops, you can book them in ECC or CAPS, and it was offered even before this program was created. There was no additional information that was given to us.
3. No coop placement at all. We need to find an internship on our own and it has some stupid requirement, has to be paid, fulltime and 1216 weeks, and has to be approved by the program coordinator, and we need to pay the program to go to an internship so that the internship would count towards credits and we can graduate. I have a friend who wants to intern at the same company and Ferrie wouldnt accept it, I was like Can Ferrie get him a job instead??? I am sure my friend would be glad to take the offer.

The only advantage would be employers can get government subsidies for hiring us. So what was the initiative of even starting this program. It doesnt have any additional benefits but fooling these students to be trapped by internships and not graduate. I know the numbershow many people go on internships are incredible, I have no clue how they got the job, maybe they have connections, they are lucky or they are just good at what they are doing and are amazing people. Maybe I suck and thats why I cant never get a job. Maybe I am the worst in my program, so I deserved to be unemployed and stuck in the program because I cannot get internships??? I am speechless at this point. I am probably not the only one but it seems like nobody cares and they never raise this issue to the admin. I am gonna assume I am the only one struggling.

!Another point that I wanna point out is the academics !

1. !TEACHING!I have no idea why the undergraduate teaching quality is so bad at McGill, is it only at McGill or its just a universal problem? Most of my professors they just read off slides and copy from textbook, or ask students to read textbooks. Why are you even here lecturing? The point of a lecture is to teach students new information in an understandable manner and the responsibility of an instructor during a lecture is to make sure they comprehensively present the course material, explain the concept clearly and how it can be applied in real life. They should make students life easier rather than showcasing their knowledge. And apparently, most of the instructors I have had at McGill cannot teach, in some worst cases, they dont even know what they are talking about in a lecture. There are indeed good profs but they are the minority. However, this might be an issue with undergraduate teaching in most institutions. I think this flaw is impacted by how professors get their research funding. Like these professors dont have an educational background, and they dont know how to teach. They are good at research and they are experts in some fields. Send them to do what they are good at, let them teach us is a waste of time for both students and themselves.
2. !Grading System! This is definitely outdated, exams and tests are the easiest way to evaluate but it is also the least effective. It makes people memorize machines and we forget most of the materials we learned if we dont use them later. However, team projects are a good way to practice and gain experience from real life. However, they just dont count as much, maybe 40 max. The grading still depends a lot on exams. And I found that the assignments and exams in some classes are completely off from lectures, which is ridiculous. For example, ECSE classes, those classes lectures are useless for assignments and projects. You must attend tutorials to know whats going on in those projects and assignments... you can literally get a zero if you just attend the lectures.
3. !Courses ! Why the heck are there so many useless courses at this school? There are a lot of classes that you know you wont touch them ever again after the final. There are also a handful of highly theoretical courses as well, no respect to philosophy major but what purpose do these classes serve? I mean if I dont want to do research, all I need is to be informed on those theories and not waste time on proofs. I wont elaborate on this cuz I am already thinking about the purpose of my life doing these proofs.

!Those are some of the things about McGill that annoys me, I am not saying its the schools fault. Like there are many factors and also considering the schools budget is soooo tight smh. Ill share some personal stories below!

I developed these views very early during my time at McGill. Probably 2 months in. I am an emotional and stubborn person and I always would like to know answers to my questions, but some of the questions, there are no valid answers, it is the way it is. Then I was diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety in December 2021, 3 months since I became a mcgill student. I started some medication to treat depression. I withdrew from all my classes and stayed at home because I have trauma with this school. I did parttime in winter 2022 and came back in Fall 2022 to be a fulltime student. I thought everything will be smooth afterwards, but unfortunately, depression hit me back in winter 2023, when I had to drop most of my classes again. During that semester, I finally decided to transfer out of this program software eng coop and to the software engineering in the faculty of science. The reason why I did that was because I got the most from credit transfer and no mandatory coop required. I could go to a totally program or a different school, somewhere I am interested in. 

To be honest, I was interested in programming and engineering before university but these experiences struck my confidence. I also used to be topperforming student like many of you do but thats no longer the case, I slack off a lot in school now, I dont even care about GPA or assignments as long as I pass and graduate. I would only focus on the truly useful courses. I am so worried about my future. For those of you, who read to this point, please spare me some advice or your thoughts on this.

Loneliness is another point that I want to share, I feel people around me are cold, all of them only mind their own business and do not give a damn about other people. I mean, I tried to blend it but people are not that friendly. I also attended some career fairs and network events, and tried a few clubs, as an introvert, I make efforts but the results are usually disappointing.

I have thought of switching career after graduating or starting a small business but nothing is set yet. In the meantime, I put in a lot of job applications for internships and never landed an internship. Still have one year left, and after 3 years at McGill, I am still struggling and suffering from mild depression.

why calling out profs who are scabbing is okay actually ,"Im seeing some people voice opinions that favour of the poor untenured profscourse lecturers who have been called out by AGSEM for scabbing.

why does their status as untenured or not matter if McGill is literally the one creating the unfortunate situation of them feeling obliged to scab in the first place by a offering TAs a shitty contract and b directing their instructors to scab. do we actually think that people are going to lose their jobs because agsem pointed out that they are scabbing? or that McGill would win an unfair dismissal lawsuit when they have communicated to instructors multiple times on record to scab? 

has McGill put the instructors in a shitty position? 100. is that AGSEMs fault? no. 

im sick of hearing wont somebody think of the profs???  

would be cool if the focus was on prcarit of TAs who are straight up going to food banks or leaving their graduate programs because they arent getting paid a living wage by a multibillion dollar company yes, company.

BIOL301 Lab  TA Strike,"Hello,

Im hoping to get some input from someone who is maximally informed on this topic regarding how this situation should be handled. BIOL301 is a lab course with a 1hour lecture and 6hour lab each week. Four lab sessions are held per week Monday  Thursday. Each lab session is staffed by four TAs who lead the prelab talk, administer and grade a quiz, answer questions during the duration of the lab, and mark the lab reports. We were informed through MyCourses that the labs would proceed this week despite the TA strike.

Yesterday, everyone in the Monday session attended the lab as normal. We were given a multiplechoice quiz rather than a longanswer quiz. The instructor who normally leads the 1hour per week lecture and does not generally attend the lab was present and led the prelab talk. We were told that we would do an abridged version of the lab due to TA absence. We normally each submit a lab report at the end of the period, but were also told that we would submit only one per pair. About 30 minutes into the lab, several representatives from AGSEM came into the lab and confronted the professor about leading a lab that is normally led by TAs. When the professor refused to cancel the lab, many more members of the union came in to make noiseprotest until the lab was canceled. The professor proceeded to go into his office for at least 15 minutes, leaving the students unsure of what to do while 20 AGSEM members rang cowbellsplayed sirensspoke through a bullhorn asking the professor to come out of his office.

The lab was ultimately canceled and we were dismissed about an hour into the 6hour lab. We have received no communication since from the instructor about what will be done in terms of grading for the lab. Today, we learned that the Tuesday lab session went ahead as scheduled, and still have had no communication from any of the course staff.

Im wondering what should be done in this situation? Are professors allowed to be holding labs this week? Since we did not have a lab and approximately 7 of our mark depends on it, what can we do to ensure that this will not negatively impact the group who did not have a lab?

Thanks in advance for any input.",1711499616,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1boobr2/biol301_lab_ta_strike/,32,United-Pineapple-753,1boobr2,3/27/2024 0:33,"['hello', 'im', 'hoping', 'get', 'input', 'someone', 'maximally', 'informed', 'topic', 'regarding', 'situation', 'handled.', 'biol', 'lab', 'course', 'hour', 'lecture', 'hour', 'lab', 'week.', 'four', 'lab', 'sessions', 'held', 'per', 'week', 'monday', 'thursday.', 'lab', 'session', 'staffed', 'four', 'tas', 'lead', 'prelab', 'talk', 'administer', 'grade', 'quiz', 'answer', 'questions', 'duration', 'lab', 'mark', 'lab', 'reports.', 'informed', 'mycourses', 'labs', 'would', 'proceed', 'week', 'despite', 'ta', 'strike.', 'yesterday', 'everyone', 'monday', 'session', 'attended', 'lab', 'normal.', 'given', 'multiplechoice', 'quiz', 'rather', 'longanswer', 'quiz.', 'instructor', 'normally', 'leads', 'hour', 'per', 'week', 'lecture', 'generally', 'attend', 'lab', 'present', 'led', 'prelab', 'talk.', 'told', 'would', 'abridged', 'version', 'lab', 'due', 'ta', 'absence.', 'normally', 'submit', 'lab', 'report', 'end', 'period', 'also', 'told', 'would', 'submit', 'one', 'per', 'pair.', 'minutes', 'lab', 'several', 'representatives', 'agsem', 'came', 'lab', 'confronted', 'professor', 'leading', 'lab', 'normally', 'led', 'tas.', 'professor', 'refused', 'cancel', 'lab', 'many', 'members', 'union', 'came', 'make', 'noiseprotest', 'lab', 'canceled.', 'professor', 'proceeded', 'go', 'office', 'least', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'students', 'unsure', 'agsem', 'members', 'rang', 'cowbellsplayed', 'sirensspoke', 'bullhorn', 'asking', 'professor', 'come', 'office.', 'lab', 'ultimately', 'canceled', 'dismissed', 'hour', 'hour', 'lab.', 'received', 'communication', 'since', 'instructor', 'done', 'terms', 'grading', 'lab.', 'today', 'learned', 'tuesday', 'lab', 'session', 'went', 'ahead', 'scheduled', 'still', 'communication', 'course', 'staff.', 'im', 'wondering', 'done', 'situation?', 'professors', 'allowed', 'holding', 'labs', 'week?', 'since', 'lab', 'approximately', 'mark', 'depends', 'ensure', 'negatively', 'impact', 'group', 'lab?', 'thanks', 'advance', 'input.']",0,0,0,0

Comp250 Updated Midterm Grading...Thoughts? TA Strike,"Due to the TA strike, only half of midterm 2 for COMP250 which is to be held tmrw, Wed March 27 is being graded....

Direct quote from the prof

Questions will be divided into pools depending on the topic they cover and then we will select the questions to grade at random from each pool assuring that we have questions that cover all of the main topics seen in class. We will grade until we have used all the midterm grading hours available to CAs and me.

Could this mean that we could select a question that some of you did not answer well? Absolutely, this is the whole point of selecting at random. 

x200B

I feel like this is very unfair... Why not make the exam multiple choice or change the format to be shorter to make grading easier?

The prof claims that by doing this, they would be breaking the law

 but by making it automatically graded thru Scantron or whatnot that wouldnt be discharging the TAs duties to another employee so I am confused about why this is illegal lol...

coming from an inner city school in US to mcgill...,"I am a U0 student from the US, and this year has taught me that my school did not prepare me at all for uni. I did go to a large innercity high school, so McGill is so different in every aspect. I was so shocked as since 6th grade I had to go threw security every day to get into school, whereas here you just walk into class. I have learned a lot, also first year is hard being so far from home and another place, compared to a lot of my friends I am not doing as well as others simply because I just dont have the same skills as them. I am wondering if any other people have these same experiences, and what did you to improve. It is frustrating because I had horrible habits in high school cause thats how my school was, and where is here these do not work. I am trying to break these habits just need some advice. is there anything at McGill Services that can help? I am taking WCOM250 which has been helpful as I never learned to write WELL. honestly,  first year of university is so formative i am really glad I started as a U0 because its allowed me to explore and figure out what i like and what i do not.  I still feel guilty because I havent done as well as I would have liked last semester, I did get an F last semester which sucks, but hopefully, this semester will be better. Also getting medication for ADHD has helped a lot. but can anyone relate to this kinda experience?

Proposed Changes to Rule 10,"Hi everyone,  

In light of recent discussions on the subreddit regarding unions and the ongoing bargaining situation, weve decided to propose a change to Rule 10 to protect against sharing private union meeting information that could be problematic for the bargaining process. We have seen support for this sort of regulation in comments lately, but as usual, we would like to hear your feedback on the proposed rule change.  

We feel that someone sharing union meeting information that they agreed to keep private in order to participate in the meeting goes against the spirit of Rule 10, which currently disallows sharing course materials and personal information that are not intended to be made public. In general, we do not want the subreddit to be used to share private information that can be harmful to students or faculty.

Rule 10 currently states

No doxxing, copyright infringement, or illegal substances  
  
Do not post anyones personal information, or discuss obtaining stolen course materials or illegal substances, including study drugs.   
  
 All of these activities violate Reddits sitewide rules, and we are required to ban violators.

and will, pending any qualms, be changed to

Do not post confidential information including doxxing   
  
Do not post anyones personal information, share confidential information about union meetingsbargaining agreements, or ask how to obtain stolen course materials or illegal substances.    
  
This rule aims to uphold Reddits sitewide rules, as well as McGill unions constitutions.

If you have any thoughts on the proposed rule change, whether you agree or disagree with it, or would like to propose a change to the wording, feel free to let us know in the comments.

Hotdog Guy Offers New Alternative to Vegan Hotdogs The MegaMeatMassacre Slaughterhouse Pork Dogs Infused with Swine Blood,"The return of The Hotdog Guy marks the start of spring for many students who finally have the opportunity to shift their 50 per day lunch fund to another, nonMcGill affiliated avenue. The new MegaMeatMassacre Slaughterhouse Pork Dogs Infused with Swine Blood meal option is turning heads and dominating the competition.

Culinary fanatics on campus have already begun singing their praises of the Godforsaken abomination I love eating it in front of the vegan cucks because if you listen closely, you can hear the pig wailing as you take each bite. Its awesome! said one fan as he downed his fourth megameatmassacre in his engineering sweater drenched in the hogs blood. When Hotdog Guy was asked what motivated him to make such a successful sausage, he informed the Faucet Infernal greed fuels the endless massacre of the swine. Thy wieners, steeped in the macabre aroma of death, whisper the dark tales of the abyss. Inspirational!

This new menu option has seen widespread success outside of individual praises, as statistics show that the pig meat monstrosity led to the most wieners to be eaten on campus since Frosh. This has not been without controversy though, as members of the McGill community have begun cancelling the beloved vendor for coinciding its sale of the exceedingly haram pig organs with the beginning of Ramadan. Hey, I would also be upset if I had to fast when such a delicious pound of hog flesh was just waiting for me to devour it!

The controversy has not just been among Muslims though, as the Student Housing and Hospitality Services scrambled to send out a statement saying, We are concerned that a marketing scheme with such a complete negligence of ethics, designed with the sole purpose of squeezing as much money from our students, is an unacceptable act of competition against us done on our own turf. This will further urge students to avoid our McGilloperated oncampus cashgrabbing food locations. Despite this comment, you can be assured that this new option remains up to the same food quality standards, as it is seasoned with equally toxic amounts of asbestos as all other eating options on campus.

"If youre a TA, vote for the strike. ","I am not on the AGSEM exec, I am a recently unionaware member. I have been honestly skeptical about strikes and unions, but talking to them and realizing the scope of what theyre fighting for has really changed my mind.

It is not easy for me to pay my rent on my TA wage. I have three more years to go. The amount McGill has proposed to raise wages is nothing. Literally it is basically nothing, like 50 or 60 cents or something . Is that really something youre willing to settle for? 

I realize I want better health care for everyone, especially international student peers to have access to health care. Dont you think thats worth at least trying to fight for? 

If we dont vote for a strike, we are locking ourselves into a crappy contract that is barely better than a pay cut, when taking into consideration inflation and COL. 

We have a chance right now to get a better, historic deal for YEARS. It would benefit everyone. Undergrads too, because as we all know, the working conditions of the TAs are the learning conditions of students. 

U of T recently got a GREAT deal for their members BECAUSE they voted for a strike. and the day before the strike, the administration folded and gave them a better bargain than what theyd originally said.

over the last couple months I have seen how much work the union does. Theyre even helping me with a grievance where I signed a contract and just didnt ever get paid. McGill screws people over in so many ways, all the time. 

Financially, a strike literally terrifies me. But I did the math and I know I will definitely sign up to picket, I will get strike pay from the parent union fund which everyone who works the picket line has access to!, and AGSEM also has a top up. 

This union is organized. They care and they are fighting for a better deal for teaching assistants. I really think we have to try.

TA strike,"Hey guys, I am a firstyear student, and I was just informed today that the TAs might go on strike and how it may affect us for the rest of the semester, such as TAs not being able to answer emails, hold office hours and conferences, and also delaying the publication of our final grades. I know nothing is confirmed as of this moment, but perhaps based on your experience at Mcgill or from past events, how likely do you think it will happen? Are they striking for a salary increase, among other things? Btw, I am not criticizing their union for putting their foot down, and I would assume that Mcgill has not shown good faith regarding the current negotiations. I am just looking to know what it would imply for myself as a student. Would the strike stretch past the end of the semester? Thanks!

"As a TA, I cant afford to strike in the short term ","Unpopular opinion, but I really wish we dont end up striking. I wont be able to afford rent without the pay, especially because as a TA all my work was front loaded in the semester so Ive already worked the hours that I should be paid for in the coming month. So essentially I would lose all that pay for work already performed. I cant pay rent if I dont work. 

Also, and this is is biased, but I graduate and yes theres the back pay, but even with an increase it will still be a net loss for me if we dont work for the next 4 payment cycles. I just dont see it. Yes theres the pay for picketing but thats just going to be extra work that I cant do because of research, and the way I front loaded my hours as a TA earlier in the semester.

Ive been very involved, have great softs but for all lawglobal affairs related stuff. Will masters programs still appreciate that??

Options for a washed up PhD?,"Hi. Ive been living in Montreal for about 7 years nowcame here in 2017 for a postdoc that didnt end poorly but also didnt result in any publications. I left the position for medical reasons plus our funding was drying up, and then the pandemic hit. I taught myself coding hoping to break into some data sciencemachine learning roles and did a professional development certificate in it from McGill as well, but that was in 2022 and I havent really had any success since thenbeen working at Provigo to make ends meet. Before that I had a brief stint for an EEG startup where I really think I flourished, but the funding dried up there too so here I am.

I want to go back to school to flesh out my EEG understanding, since I wasnt enough of an expert at the startup to stand on my own without the team I was working with. However, since I already have a PhD in neuroscience, this puts me in a weird position. Im looking at some computational neuroscience courses that I could take, but I dont really see anything that would formalize the work and studies I would do. This would kind of defeat the purpose of it all since my primary goal with all of this is to find a job, so does anyone have any suggestions on what I might be able to take or do at McGill that would help me address the situation?",1709241198,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1b3bjg5/options_for_a_washed_up_phd/,4,oniraikou,1b3bjg5,2/29/2024 21:13,"['hi.', 'ive', 'living', 'montreal', 'years', 'nowcame', 'postdoc', 'didnt', 'end', 'poorly', 'also', 'didnt', 'result', 'publications.', 'left', 'position', 'medical', 'reasons', 'plus', 'funding', 'drying', 'pandemic', 'hit.', 'taught', 'coding', 'hoping', 'break', 'data', 'sciencemachine', 'learning', 'roles', 'professional', 'development', 'certificate', 'mcgill', 'well', 'havent', 'really', 'success', 'since', 'thenbeen', 'working', 'provigo', 'make', 'ends', 'meet.', 'brief', 'stint', 'eeg', 'startup', 'really', 'think', 'flourished', 'funding', 'dried', 'am.', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'flesh', 'eeg', 'understanding', 'since', 'wasnt', 'enough', 'expert', 'startup', 'stand', 'without', 'team', 'working', 'with.', 'however', 'since', 'already', 'phd', 'neuroscience', 'puts', 'weird', 'position.', 'im', 'looking', 'computational', 'neuroscience', 'courses', 'could', 'take', 'dont', 'really', 'see', 'anything', 'would', 'formalize', 'work', 'studies', 'would', 'do.', 'would', 'kind', 'defeat', 'purpose', 'since', 'primary', 'goal', 'find', 'job', 'anyone', 'suggestions', 'might', 'able', 'take', 'mcgill', 'would', 'help', 'address', 'situation?']",1,1,0,0

Abusive Security at Unity,"Honestly not sure if this is totally the right place to post this, but wanted to get this out there and warn other students about the experience my friends and I had at Unity last night. 

Was going into the club, showed my ID, and was getting pat down by the bouncer. The bouncer was patting me quite aggressively, and was touching my breasts to the point that I felt really uncomfortable and said you dont need to touch me like that. When I said this, he physically grabbed me and shoved me out the door saying You arent fucking getting in here tonight. I obviously was pretty shaken up and shocked by this, and waited outside the club to call my friends who were inside and explain the situation. For context Id had about three drinks over a few hours at this point and was sober.

As I was waiting outside, I saw the security guard who had touched me inappropriately, along with another man, drag a young woman outside. She clearly was intoxicated and not herself. I absolutely understand the need to remove a drunken person from a club, but one of the security guards proceeded to pin her to the ground facedown, holding her there and shoving her face and head into the pavement. It was 12 degrees Celsius tonight and she was not wearing a coat. I obviously did not witness the events that led to her being escorted from the club, but I cannot believe there is ever a reason for a small young woman to be pinned to the ground and held there by a much larger man, when she was clearly unwell and not posing a threat to those around her. I have a video of this but out of respect for her privacy I will not be posting it.

Myself and my friends left Unity extremely disgusted and shaken by what we experienced and saw. I sincerely hope the young woman we saw abused by security is okay. If her or any of her friends see this and wish to see the video, please reach out. I just wanted to share this so that other people can avoid similar situations and be aware of the fact that Unity employs men who harass and physically hurt women.

I got into a PhD program at McGill and I am highly considering accepting. The only concern I have is stipend  funding.

Lease Rent Increase Refuse the Increase but Opt to Stay,"Its 2024 lease renewal season for many of us.

I just got mine, it proposes a 5.4 increase. Yes, its not super high considering the general recommendation of 4 for 2024, but my rent includes everything hydro, heating, my landlord has been doing a truly subpar maintenance and followup work, I havent had a renovation for years, etc. But the biggest shock to me is that in the lease, I was just given two options accept the increase or quit the lease. Is this normal or even legal jaccepte le renouvellement du bail avec ses modifications and je vais quitter a la fin du present bail?

I thought theres always the 3rd option to refuse the increase but opting to stay and probably going to TAL later on??

And second question, if I want the 3rd option, what should I do? Should I just email or call them up directly to negotiate? Or use some kind of technical form which I wasnt provided for in this case.

No floor fellows next year,"If you are in the subreddit because you are planning to come to McGill next year and live in residence, you need to hear this. McGill is firing all floor fellows McGill equivalent of RADon. They are not replacing them with another job, there will simply be no support for first years living in residence. Coming from someone who was a floor fellow last year, I know how important ffs are to first year. Not only are they there to make sure that the residence remains a safe place, but they are also available for 247 mental or physical health emergencies. I cannot count the number of times students came to me with questions, concerns, or problems. Ffs are trained in CPR and mental health firstaid. They are a NECESSITY to firstyears living in residence.
To all parents of future McGill students do you really want your child going to a school where they do not care about the safety of your child in residence. 
I am so saddened to have to make this post, but I feel it is important that incoming students know what theyre in for.  

Edit For those of you who thought I was overstating the importance of Floor Fellows or thought that students would be safe in residence with out them, I would like to direct your attention to the two students who have died in residence this year. I will obviously not speculate on the causes of death out respect for the students and their families and friends, but I will wonder if the presence of a floor fellow could have helped in any way. My deepest condolences to those who have been impacted by these death.
I sincerely hope no more students have to die before McGill takes a good hard look at their failing residence program.

"Professor forcing a grade K on all students and drags on the course through the next semester, is this allowed?","Is a professor allowed to create a onesemester class worth one semesters credits where the final project has work that extends all the way into the next semester, for which all students automatically get a grade K by the end of the first semester the K is the profs decision, and students have no say, and only gets a final grade at the end of the second semester? We have a onesemester class in the fall semester, for which the final project is to produce an orchestral score. By December, we all submitted our orchestration, and in theory, we should be done with the class. However, everyone gets a grade K, because theres a second part to that project, which is to have the score performed by the McGill orchestra during spring. For that, we will have to render our final score that we submitted last December into a professional looking score which takes a loooong time, and then produce parts for each instrument. All this is done during the winter semester, with no additional credits earned. Essentially this fall semester class is being dragged into the winter semester. I wanted to opt out of the performance, so that I dont have to do whats basically another extra classs worth of work during this busy midterm. I just wanna be done with this class right now. But the professor is leveraging on the grade K to get me to finish this second part of the final score making it professional and producing parts, essentially saying that he could still make me fail this class if I dont take time this semester to work on a class that shouldve ended last semester. To make it clear, everybody in this class automatically gets the grade K after December 2023, its forced on by the professor, who will finally give the final grade by the end of April 2023, after the performance of our scores. In theory, I should have the right to tell the professor to just give me my final mark right now and opt out of the performance and still pass this class right? The bizarre layout of this class was indeed mentioned in the course syllabus, so us students kindof agreed on this procedure without actually knowing the implications, but I am so busy right now that I just wanna not do the extra part.",1707283276,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1akvfw7/professor_forcing_a_grade_k_on_all_students_and/,18,TennonHorse,1akvfw7,2/7/2024 5:21,"['professor', 'allowed', 'create', 'onesemester', 'class', 'worth', 'one', 'semesters', 'credits', 'final', 'project', 'work', 'extends', 'way', 'next', 'semester', 'students', 'automatically', 'get', 'grade', 'k', 'end', 'first', 'semester', 'k', 'profs', 'decision', 'students', 'say', 'gets', 'final', 'grade', 'end', 'second', 'semester?', 'onesemester', 'class', 'fall', 'semester', 'final', 'project', 'produce', 'orchestral', 'score.', 'december', 'submitted', 'orchestration', 'theory', 'done', 'class.', 'however', 'everyone', 'gets', 'grade', 'k', 'theres', 'second', 'part', 'project', 'score', 'performed', 'mcgill', 'orchestra', 'spring.', 'render', 'final', 'score', 'submitted', 'last', 'december', 'professional', 'looking', 'score', 'takes', 'loooong', 'time', 'produce', 'parts', 'instrument.', 'done', 'winter', 'semester', 'additional', 'credits', 'earned.', 'essentially', 'fall', 'semester', 'class', 'dragged', 'winter', 'semester.', 'wanted', 'opt', 'performance', 'dont', 'whats', 'basically', 'another', 'extra', 'classs', 'worth', 'work', 'busy', 'midterm.', 'wanna', 'done', 'class', 'right', 'now.', 'professor', 'leveraging', 'grade', 'k', 'get', 'finish', 'second', 'part', 'final', 'score', 'making', 'professional', 'producing', 'parts', 'essentially', 'saying', 'could', 'still', 'make', 'fail', 'class', 'dont', 'take', 'time', 'semester', 'work', 'class', 'shouldve', 'ended', 'last', 'semester.', 'make', 'clear', 'everybody', 'class', 'automatically', 'gets', 'grade', 'k', 'december', 'forced', 'professor', 'finally', 'give', 'final', 'grade', 'end', 'april', 'performance', 'scores.', 'theory', 'right', 'tell', 'professor', 'give', 'final', 'mark', 'right', 'opt', 'performance', 'still', 'pass', 'class', 'right?', 'bizarre', 'layout', 'class', 'indeed', 'mentioned', 'course', 'syllabus', 'us', 'students', 'kindof', 'agreed', 'procedure', 'without', 'actually', 'knowing', 'implications', 'busy', 'right', 'wanna', 'extra', 'part.']",1,0,0,0
Bachelor of Arts diploma in English instead of Latin,"Hello!
I am a McGill alumnus currently losing her mind because I cannot find a tangible way to get a version of my McGill diploma in English instead of Latin.

Im currently in the process of applying for a masters degree abroad in Europe and they require an original English diploma a certified English translation of the Latin diploma simply wont suffice according to the agency Im speaking with. 

There doesnt seem to be any useful information regarding this issue on McGills website so Im casting a net here to see if maybe anyone has any helpful information or ishas been in the same predicament as Im in. 

Ive sent an inquiry via email but it says it could take between 35 days to get a response, as well as booking a virtual service point appointment for as soon as possible, so while I wait I figured I should look for answers elsewhere.

Help Discontinued Program Worries,"Im a U2 student grandfathered into a program that was discontinued as of September 2023.

The audit form for my program lays out which courses should be taken in U1, U2, and U3. However, there are multiple U3 courses extremely relevant to the program that are apparently not going to be offered next year. Me and many of the people in my program were given no notice to take these courses earlier than the form indicates.

I know of several people in my situation who have met with our programs academic advisor and were basically being told we will have to wait and see if they decide to offer it, and that they may allow substitutions if not most of these courses are super specific and nothing remotely close exists at McGill or even Concordia so Im not sure how they will adeqautely do this.

I was under the impression that being grandfathered in this program implied that those still enrolled would have sufficient time to complete the program, properly.

Transfer to eng faculty,"Hi, I am planning on applying for a transfer to the faculty of engineering Im in arts and was wondering if anyone could give me some sort of basis or reference point of my chances. I would want to transfer into chemical engineering 

Ive seen the gpa table on the engineering website and the general trend seems to be around 3.43.5 for the lowest accepted gpa. Ive asked the engineering advisor and she simply told me I need to get a higher gpa than everyone else and thats it essentially. 

Im sitting at 3.66 cgpa, Ive taken math 140 C, chem 120 A, math 141 A, and Im currently taking math 133 and phys 102. 

Im just worried about my math 140 grade as I did not as well as what I had hoped however got a high grade in math 141. Because of that would my math 140 grade be kinda looked over since I got a better grade in the class above?

Ive also taken chem 212 A and am taking chem 222. Would these classes contribute in anyway to helping me get into chem eng apart from simply affecting my gpa ? 

Ive heard from people that you generally need like a 3.9 to maybe get accepted is that true or more like a myth? 
Approximately when would I know if they approved the transfer or not? Would it be in like June or could I know in August?

Thank you!

Edit got my final grades for math 133 and phys 102 same as 142 so my grades for applying 
 chem 120 A
 math 140 C
 math 141 A
 math 133 B
 phys 102 A

Change my View CMV Beyond the Curve Why Grades Arent Everything,"x200B

Scrolling through the posts on our beloved subreddit, Ive noticed a recurring theme an almost obsessive focus on grades. Its as if these numbers, these arbitrary symbols on a piece of paper, hold the key to our selfworth and potential futures.

But lets be real, grades are just one aspect of our lives. They dont define our intelligence, our creativity, or our ability to contribute to the world in meaningful ways. In fact, an unhealthy obsession with grades can actually hinder our personal growth and limit our experiences.

Imagine a world where were not constantly graded, where our worth isnt tied to our academic performance. Instead, were encouraged to explore our passions, to take risks, to fail and learn from our mistakes. Were pushed to step outside our comfort zones, to challenge ourselves, to discover our hidden talents.

This isnt to say that academic achievement isnt important. Studying, learning, and acquiring knowledge are essential for personal growth and success in various fields. But when grades become the sole measure of our worth, we miss out on the richness and diversity of lifes experiences.

Instead of obsessing over that A, why not spend time volunteering in your community, learning a new language, or pursuing a hobby that sparks your curiosity? These experiences will shape you into a wellrounded individual, equipped with skills and knowledge that go beyond the classroom.

So, dear readers, lets break free from the shackles of gradecentered society. Embrace the beauty of lifes experiences, the lessons learned from failures and successes. Dont let a few numbers dictate your selfworth or define your potential.

Remember, the world is full of opportunities waiting to be explored. Dont let a piece of paper hold you back from living a fulfilling and meaningful life.",1704063825,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/18vjfz1/change_my_view_cmv_beyond_the_curve_why_grades/,20,pandaeau330,18vjfz1,12/31/2023 23:03,"['xb', 'scrolling', 'posts', 'beloved', 'subreddit', 'ive', 'noticed', 'recurring', 'theme', 'almost', 'obsessive', 'focus', 'grades.', 'numbers', 'arbitrary', 'symbols', 'piece', 'paper', 'hold', 'key', 'selfworth', 'potential', 'futures.', 'lets', 'real', 'grades', 'one', 'aspect', 'lives.', 'dont', 'define', 'intelligence', 'creativity', 'ability', 'contribute', 'world', 'meaningful', 'ways.', 'fact', 'unhealthy', 'obsession', 'grades', 'actually', 'hinder', 'personal', 'growth', 'limit', 'experiences.', 'imagine', 'world', 'constantly', 'graded', 'worth', 'isnt', 'tied', 'academic', 'performance.', 'instead', 'encouraged', 'explore', 'passions', 'take', 'risks', 'fail', 'learn', 'mistakes.', 'pushed', 'step', 'outside', 'comfort', 'zones', 'challenge', 'discover', 'hidden', 'talents.', 'isnt', 'say', 'academic', 'achievement', 'isnt', 'important.', 'studying', 'learning', 'acquiring', 'knowledge', 'essential', 'personal', 'growth', 'success', 'various', 'fields.', 'grades', 'become', 'sole', 'measure', 'worth', 'miss', 'richness', 'diversity', 'lifes', 'experiences.', 'instead', 'obsessing', 'spend', 'time', 'volunteering', 'community', 'learning', 'new', 'language', 'pursuing', 'hobby', 'sparks', 'curiosity?', 'experiences', 'shape', 'wellrounded', 'individual', 'equipped', 'skills', 'knowledge', 'go', 'beyond', 'classroom.', 'dear', 'readers', 'lets', 'break', 'free', 'shackles', 'gradecentered', 'society.', 'embrace', 'beauty', 'lifes', 'experiences', 'lessons', 'learned', 'failures', 'successes.', 'dont', 'let', 'numbers', 'dictate', 'selfworth', 'define', 'potential.', 'remember', 'world', 'full', 'opportunities', 'waiting', 'explored.', 'dont', 'let', 'piece', 'paper', 'hold', 'back', 'living', 'fulfilling', 'meaningful', 'life.']",1,0,0,0
Is this harassment?,"I feel like I got harassed by the front desk receptionist at the mcgill athletic recreation. The guy with red hair, black rim glasses and tattoo and about 30 years old. 

I have been friendly with this person and knew him since last year. By being friendly I mean just greeting and made some small talk when I see him. Nothing else, just basic social courtesy. He knows my name and can definitely recognize me since I went to the gym very frequently, like 4 times a week. 

Last week he suddenly asked me if I was gonna go back home and spend time with my boyfriend. It was a weird question since I never mentioned I had a boyfriend. And usually people went back home to spend time with their family. Naturally l said I dont have a boyfriend. And he proceeded I dont have a girlfriend as well. I felt uneasy instantly but did not say anything.
I dont what it was, maybe its just a weird conversation, maybe he is just awkward. I tried to not overthink. 

Then the next day he greeted me again, but this time he reaches his hand out to me. I thought he was asking for a handshake, but the instant my hand reached his hand he dragged me towards him. Even tho I was trying to pull my hand back. I felt uneasy but I was not sure what it was. I was confused because I never thought he would be interested in me given his profession and age. I never thought in that direction. I did not say anything as I was unsure.

Things escalated really quickly yesterday. I was trying to be very cautious to him since that first really uncomfortable conversation happened. After my workout I was gonna leave. I saw there was no one at the frontdesk, and that moment I felt relieved because I dont need to deal with him again. Then I saw him at the frontdoor, I got tensed up again, I greeted him very fast and tried to pass by him quickly. 

The moment I passed by him he put his hand on the top of my head, suppressing me really hard and I could barely move. My mind was blank partly because I just finished my workout and was tired, partly because I did not expect that happening at all.

I got rid of him and quickly ran outside. Before he let me go I can hear him saying  you are so small.

That just gross me out.

Now I am not sure what to do.  Should I report to the upper management? I want to hear peoples opinions on this.

LUniversit McGill dmnage au Nunavut!,"Dans un tournant surprenant, lUniversit McGill a annonc son intention de dplacer tout son campus au Nunavut. Ce dmnagement sans prcdent devrait rsoudre plusieurs problmes en cours.

Tout dabord, le fiasco des frais de scolarit hors province ne sera plus quun lointain souvenir. Avec luniversit niche au cur de la nature sauvage du Nunavut, le concept de hors province sera aussi teint que les dinosaures. Tout le monde sera galement hors province, ce qui galisera les chances pour tous les tudiants.

Deuximement, ce dmnagement liminera effectivement langlais de Montral. La ville pourra enfin sadonner pleinement  ses racines franaises sans le rappel constant de la prsence anglophone.

Troisiement, cette relocalisation endiguera la migration anglaise. Avec le dpart de la principale institution anglophone vers le Nunavut, la population anglophone naura que peu de raisons de rester. Cela pourrait entraner une diminution significative de la population anglophone au Qubec, renforant ainsi lidentit francophone de la province.

En outre, ce dmnagement favorisera la mdiocrit au Qubec. Avec le dpart de lune des meilleures universits du Canada, le niveau acadmique au Qubec sera invitablement abaiss. Cela pourrait conduire  une atmosphre acadmique plus dtendue, o tout le monde peut se sentir comme un tudiant de premier plan.

Et ce nest pas tout ! Avec le dpart de luniversit et de tous ses emplois pour les travailleurs et les tudiants anglophones, il y aura beaucoup despace pour les nouveaux immigrants du MoyenOrient ! Montral pourrait bien devenir la Marseille de lAmrique, un vritable creuset de cultures et de traditions diverses. Imaginez les rues de Montral animes par une nouvelle vague de diversit culturelle, culinaire et artistique. Quelle vision excitante pour lavenir !

Enfin, la nature sauvage du Nunavut offrira lendroit parfait pour les manifestants veills. Avec beaucoup despace et peu de distractions, ils seront libres dexprimer leurs points de vue et de manifester  leur guise. La nature sauvage de Nunavut pourrait bien devenir le nouveau centre du militantisme social.

Alors, prparez vos chiens de traineau et vos bottes de neige, tudiants de McGill ! Nunavut vous attend !

sincrement,

Are students with unavoidable conflicts going to have to defer to March, and if so, how will they submit a deferral request and be accepted before the exam tomorrow?

In line with our commitment to keep you apprised of developments concerning the archeological investigation of the site of the former Royal Victoria Hospital, I write to share the following update. 

Yesterday, the Superior Court of Quebec rendered its decision regarding the application of the Settlement Agreement reached last April. 

We will study the decision and its implications more fully in the days to come. In the meantime, as per the courts decision, the work at the site may continue.

Anyone thinking of transferring if the tuition hikes go through?,"I know the hike doesnt even current students directly, but I feel like the changes are going to affect McGills resources and educational quality.

Why McGill did not forced French courses?,"Hi everyone,

Ive been accepted to both Udem and McGill, but ultimately I chose Udem. 

I dont understand why McGill except for some programs does not force French courses. Here at Udem and in every French speaking university it is mandatory to have an advanced level of English in order to graduate. First there is a test and then if you dont pass the test you have to take several courses in order to reach the level of English advanced. It is a condition to graduate even for the international students. 

If McGill would have done that like every French speaking university I believe that the govrnment would not have increased fees for international students or at least negociation would have been possible. What a shame, once again it is internation students who are penalized and i am sure many of them would have been okay to have French courses. 

Is there a reason why McGill did not require a language requirement except some programs like all French speaking universities do in English?",1699396261,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/17q6ikz/why_mcgill_did_not_forced_french_courses/,99,battosa89,17q6ikz,11/7/2023 22:31,"['hi', 'everyone', 'ive', 'accepted', 'udem', 'mcgill', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'udem.', 'dont', 'understand', 'mcgill', 'except', 'programs', 'force', 'french', 'courses.', 'udem', 'every', 'french', 'speaking', 'university', 'mandatory', 'advanced', 'level', 'english', 'order', 'graduate.', 'first', 'test', 'dont', 'pass', 'test', 'take', 'several', 'courses', 'order', 'reach', 'level', 'english', 'advanced.', 'condition', 'graduate', 'even', 'international', 'students.', 'mcgill', 'would', 'done', 'like', 'every', 'french', 'speaking', 'university', 'believe', 'govrnment', 'would', 'increased', 'fees', 'international', 'students', 'least', 'negociation', 'would', 'possible.', 'shame', 'internation', 'students', 'penalized', 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'okay', 'french', 'courses.', 'reason', 'mcgill', 'require', 'language', 'requirement', 'except', 'programs', 'like', 'french', 'speaking', 'universities', 'english?']",1,0,0,0
Theres a special place in hell reserved for TAs who dont give feedback,"The TAs in PHIL classes seem to be allergic to giving feedback. I dont need much, but just one or two lines about the biggest problem in my essay or what I could do to improve. Its really hard to not have any idea why you lost points. You have to go to the prof for feedback but they dont know why the TA graded the way they did. Ive had bad luck just asking the TA why they graded the way they did, like they dont want to spend time doing their job.  


Its really frustrating and Im wondering if anyone else feels the same way. I know it really depends on the TA, but I find since last year the quality of TAs really went down, like they really dont give two shits about us and want us to suffer. Maybe they do, maybe they dont and they just really dont care. But I am sure they benefitted from good TAs to get into grad school. Anyways.

"With the current tuition hike, McGill should consider moving out of Quebec.","Email from McGills Principle,

Enrolment at McGill will drop Many Canadian students from outside Quebec will likely not come to McGill because their tuition in 2024 for comparable programs will be much higher than in universities elsewhere in Canada. We are working to recruit a greater number of prospective students from Quebec or from countries around the world to fill the places normally taken by students from the rest of Canada. However, our estimates show that in the bestcase scenario, we will fill no more than 80 per cent of these spaces, and in the worstcase scenario, we will fill no more than 20 per cent, thereby reducing the number of students coming to McGill.   
  
Annual enrolment revenue will drop Our analysis shows that the potential overall revenue loss in tuition fees will range from 42 million to 94 million annually. With respect to international student tuition fees, the loss will be 24.5 million. The financial impact of the changes to tuition fees for Canadian students from outside Quebec will depend on many variables but we estimate a loss of at least 20 per cent of those students, and up to 80 per cent, which translates into an annual loss of between 17.6 million and 69.8 million.   
  
Some Faculties will lose all their students from the rest of Canada, with no ability to replace them The consequences will be especially devastating for the Schulich School of Music, which has an undergraduate student population composed of almost 40 per cent from the rest of Canada. The new tuition fee will likely be costprohibitive for new students and will place the School in jeopardy. The Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, the Faculty of Education and the B.A.  Sc. interfaculty programs will also be severely affected.   
  
Measures will have to be implemented to protect McGills financial stability Given the financial uncertainty the new tuition policy will bring, it will be necessary to implement some measures including a hiring freeze, job reductions that could reach between 650 and 700, a deferral of planned expenditures and additional nonsalary reductions in expenditures. Of course, we will do everything in our power to minimize any future job reductions.   
  
Our ability to move forward with major infrastructure projects will be compromised The projected revenue loss will reduce McGills borrowing limit and capacity to service debt. In addition, the cost of borrowing money to fund infrastructure projects will increase for the University. These increased costs may force us to suspend some projects. Banks have already raised McGills shortterm borrowing rate following the Governments announcement.    
  
Varsity teams will see a major impact we may have to suspend or cut some McGill Redbirds and Martlets teams, given that a third of our studentathletes are from outofprovince.     


 Seem like the tuition fee hike have really dire consequences to to McGill. In addition, to the quoted consequences. McGills ability to attract more students and researchers will also be impacted and the standings of the school will drop, which could also send it into a death spiral.  


While, staying in Quebec protects McGills history. McGill overall history is better protected by keeping its rankings and the schools diversity alive.

"Mcgills Lying Mcgill, Mohawk Mothers, and New Potential MKUltra Findings","So Im posting today on behalf of the Mohawk Mothers, who  have been engaged in a legal battle with promoters of the New Vic project to stall future excavation of the former Royal Victoria Hospital site until a proper archaeological investigation is conducted. Heres the basic information you need to know

 Royal Victoria Hospital is being constructed into a new complex on the McGill University campus. Once considered a hospital for the poor, it served many Indigenous and Inuit patients. The hospital closed and moved to a new site in 2015.

In October 2022, the Mohawk Mothers obtained an injunction against the construction project from the Superior Court of Quebec it halted all site excavation until a proper investigation and archaeological plan could be conducted.   In a preliminary investigation anthropologist P. Blouin outlined evidence supporting the claim that the Royal Victoria Hospital site may hide unmarked Indigenous graves. The injunction issued by Justice Gregory Moore was issued Mohawk Mothers concerns that Indigenous children were used as test subjects in medical experiments at the Royal Victoria Hospital, and were potentially buried on the site slated for redevelopment. These concerns were based on both archival evidence and witness accounts, including a firsthand account of Lana Ponting, 81, a survivor of the CIAfunded MKULTRA mind control experiments.

In October 2022, the Mohawk Mothers obtained an injunction against the construction project from the Superior Court of Quebec it halted all excavation of the site until a proper investigation and archaeological plan could be conducted.

 Mcgill is being uncooperative and not sticking to their promised settlement of providing an indigenousled investigation and excavating an area with potentially unmarked graves without consent.

There has been instances of construction workers on site mishandling potential evidence in the area. In April of 2023, McGill and the SQI rejected recommendations from the Panel to include a forensics expert to oversee the chain of custody of artifacts, which is an essential aspect of a credible investigation.

Ultimately, The Mohawk Mothers  bestcase scenario is to be provided a proper investigation, which aims to find all the children who have disappeared, using the best practices to do so and to offer closure to the families by disclosing the full story of how they went missing. Mcgill and SQIs bestcase scenario is to build a building on time based on a timeline they created for themselves, and not include this horrific story to their reputation.

I share this today because I want to believe Montreal is a good place. I want to think that through sharing this information, you, the reader, will also want to make a difference. There are so many accounts of indigenous peoples being disappointed again and again by institutional systems. We, the public can in the LEAST help the Mohawk Mothers find the truth of what happened at the Old Vic site. Please please please share this information, as well as donate.

 I would sneak out of my room at the Allan at night, and walk down the front steps and I would hide. I found people standing over by the cement wall, with shovels. Two were on one side of the wall and one was on the other side. I remember that vividly because they had red handles on the shovels and a flashlight. What were they doing with shovels over by the concrete fence? There is only one thing that comes into my mind, were they burying something in the ground. What else could it be? There were rumors that there are bodies buried in the Allan property, and I believe that some of them would be Indigenous people.

Jcris donc aujourdhui au nom des Mres Mohawk, qui ont engag une bataille juridique avec les promoteurs du projet New Vic pour bloquer les futures fouilles sur le site de lancien hpital Royal Victoria jusqu ce quune tude archologique approprie soit mene. Voici les informations de base que vous devez connatre 

 Lhpital Royal Victoria est en cours de construction dans un nouveau complexe sur le campus de lUniversit McGill. Autrefois considr comme un hpital pour les pauvres, il accueillait de nombreux patients autochtones et inuits. Lhpital a ferm ses portes et a dmnag sur un nouveau site en 2015.

 Depuis 2015, les Mohawk Mothers tentent dempcher la construction du site et sengagent  fouiller le terrain  la recherche de tombes anonymes et de preuves non dcouvertes lies au programme mdical MKULTRA de la CIA. Lors dune enqute prliminaire, lanthropologue P. Blouin a prsent des preuves  lappui de laffirmation selon laquelle le site de lhpital Royal Victoria pourrait cacher des tombes indignes anonymes. Les mres mohawks sinquitent que des enfants indignes aient t utiliss comme sujets de tests dans des expriences mdicales  lhpital Royal Victoria, et potentiellement enterrs sur le site prvu pour le ramnagement. Ces inquitudes taient fondes sur des archives et des tmoignages, notamment celui de Lana Ponting, 81 ans, survivante des expriences de contrle mental MKULTRA finances par la CIA.

En octobre 2022, les Mres Mohawk ont obtenu de la Cour suprieure du Qubec une injonction contre le projet de construction, qui a interrompu toute excavation sur le site jusqu ce quune enqute approprie et un plan archologique puissent tre mens.

 Mcgill se montre peu coopratif et ne respecte pas sa promesse de fournir une enqute mene par des autochtones et de creuser sans consentement une zone o se trouvent des tombes potentiellement non marques.Il y a eu des cas o des travailleurs de la construction sur le site ont mal manipul des preuves potentielles dans la rgion. En avril 2023, McGill et lIQS ont rejet les recommandations du groupe dexperts visant  inclure un expert en criminalistique pour superviser la chane de possession des artefacts, un aspect essentiel dune enqute crdible.

En fin de compte, le meilleur scnario pour les Mres Mohawk est de bnficier dune enqute approprie, qui vise  retrouver tous les enfants qui ont disparu, en utilisant les meilleures pratiques pour ce faire, et  permettre aux familles de tourner la page en rvlant lhistoire complte de la disparition des enfants. Le meilleur scnario pour Mcgill et SQI est de construire un btiment  temps, selon le calendrier quils se sont fix, et de ne pas inclure cette horrible histoire dans leur rputation.

Je partage cette histoire aujourdhui parce que je veux croire que Montral est un bon endroit. Je veux croire quen partageant cette information, vous, le lecteur, voudrez aussi faire une diffrence. Il y a tant de rcits de peuples indignes dus encore et encore par les systmes institutionnels. Nous, le public, pouvons au MOINS aider les Mres Mohawk  dcouvrir la vrit sur ce qui sest pass sur le site dOld Vic. Je vous invite  partager cette information et  faire un don.

A lot of comments are asking about the efficacy of the evidence. Id like to let everyone know this is an ONGOING investigation. The issue is that McGill and SQI agreed to an indigenousled investigation and went back on that.

"Humiliated in front of my crush, what to do?","I really need help. I think I ruined my chances with her.

To make it simple, I had just left a particularly intense lecture and was heading to the library.  As I walked down a seemingly deserted corridor, my stomach grumbled ominously. I quickened my pace, hoping to find a restroom before my internal turmoil became external. Alas, it was not to be. The nearest restroom seemed miles away, and my stomach had its own sense of urgency. 

I think you can guess the rest, but just in case   In a desperate bid to alleviate the pressure, I tried to release a silent, stealthy toot, but my unfortunate toot had other plans. It didnt just make a simple exit it echoed like a trumpet solo in a quiet symphony hall. It was as if the spirits of engineering students past had turned my expulsion of gas into a grand musical performance. 

I tried to regain my composure, but the universe seemed determined to extend the comedy show at my expense. It was then that I noticed, through the stifled laughter of the onlookers, that my crush was among them. Her usually serene face twisted into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. She tried to hide it, but her giggles escaped. I felt my face flush a shade of red that no amount of crimson engineering building bricks could match. 

Its been a few days now and I still havent spoken to her. I dont know how to approach it, what should I do?

Younger kink scene,"throwaway 

Does anyone know any BDSM student groups at McGill or just groups in Montreal? I havent been able to find anything online or on here and Id love to talk and meet with members of the community around the same age. Im sure it exists but not sure how to find them without anyone introducing me

On Fetlife most people seem to be in their 3040s and as an undergrad student who is new to the scene, I would feel way more comfortable and feel more safe? communicating and going to events with people my age rather than 1015 years older. Im also really intimidated by the idea of just showing up at a munch lol.

Have I just not found them, am I looking in the wrong place? Is there a community at McGill or around?

"Tuition Hike Protest, Monday, October 30th","Hey fellow McGillians,

Im Alex, a secondyear student here studying Political Science  English. After the news broke of which we are all now aware of and absolutely flamed about I decided to organize protest action. As such, we have been approved by the SPVM to march on Monday, October 30th, at 100 PM, starting at Dorchester Square Park, located at 2903 Peel Street. Our route is found below we will be concluding the march at the Roddick Gates. For routine info updates, please follow  bluefallprotest on Instagram.

For those who may be unfamiliar with our cause, feel free to take into account the following

The diversity of McGills attendees speaks to the current socioeconomic, ethnic, and perhaps most importantly, the interest differences that the McGill student body  and the city of Montreal  maintains. As such, the language issue is at the tip of the iceberg of a much larger systemic issue  and what I believe to be a plan  by the Quebec government to not only homogenize its public universities on a linguistic level, but on class and academic levels as well. Leaving higher education institutions like McGill in this position will only leave opportunities for workingclass students such as myself from Canada outside of Quebec completely out of reach on a purely economic level. Furthermore, international students will now be able to attend Yale, the University of Pennsylvania or Harvard for up to roughly fiftythousand dollars less than they would at McGill for unregulated faculties, for example. It is all to say, that international students  of which 12,001 come from outside of the province, as of the most recent numbers, though these numbers include unaffected graduate and PhD students  will be much less attracted to McGill, and as a result, less talent from outside of the province will enroll, which in turn means that less funding altogether, will occur.

This all being said, the exclusion of French and Belgian students from this tuition increase is a clear message to English universities, as stated by Pascale Dry, the current minister of higher education, to avoid the irrational fear of anglicizing Montreal. I would argue that this ironically conflicts with the provinces current immigration policy, one that has allowed just recently tens of thousands of people to settle in the province from North Africa and the Middle EastSWANA individuals who are skilled professionals in their field and fluent in French. To that end, McGill is a gateway for many international students to Quebecs diverse cultural and educational traditions. I routinely encourage prospective students to take French as a Second Language FSL courses during their undergraduate degree. To double tuition would be to completely rid these opportunities for global talent to contribute to both McGill and Quebec as an entity more general, and learn what the government has very much deemed as a common, intercultural language within Quebec society. Thus, in addition to class elements, there are evident racial elements that play into this decision as well  something that does not again, speak to who we are as an institution.

We are in the middle of mobilizing staff unions as well I will also be appearing on various media outlets within the coming days with my partner, who attends Concordia, and is mobilizing student organizations affiliated with that university to join us.

We encourage everyone to dress in McGill red! Feel free to go all out and make signage as well to bring with you. Please be sure to be mindful of those around you, remain peaceful and do not provoke or incite any sort of verbally or physically abusive behaviour. I want to make this event as accessible as possible, and especially on the note of signage, no hateful commentary relating to xenophobia, homophobia, intellectual or physical disability, or class will be tolerated. This is rhetorical, but I am just stating this to be extra clear. In other words, dont be an ahole! It isnt that hard.

Should you have any further questions about the protest itself, you may follow the cause  bluefallprotest on Instagram, where updates will be routinely posted, and our DMs will be left open to ensure that all concerns are dealt with accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing you all there!

McGill needs to stop prioritizing rankings,"A large component of rankings is internationalization. The more international students enrolled, the higher the rank. The more foreign trained profs, the higher the rank. However, this says very little about the relative quality of an institution and how qualified the people who populate it are.

Now McGill and other Canadian universities have likely prioritized rankings in recent years, but they have not prioritized undergraduate aspects. So no, your class is not necessarily better than Northwestern, Dartmouth or Brown because McGill has a higher rank.

So what will happen if these ranking publications simply change the criteria and focus more on class sizes, qualifications and impact? McGill will drop like a rock. By the way USNews did this this past year and some universities in America dropped 10, 20 or 30 spots

Some of the most famous or promoted rankings are British, and they appear to favour British universities over American ones.

DO NOT EAT REDPATH POKE SALMON,"I used to always eat from Redpaths Poke Bar. The fresh salmon, sticky rice, and ripe mango used to make my day whenever I had a decentsized break between classes. The combination of flavors and sauces was always so fresh and delicious, filling my mouth with a million textures and flavors like I was chewing on a rainbow.

However, this has all changed this year. When ordering from the bar, Ive recently noticed the raw salmon looking a lot less fresh and having a strange smell to it. I consider myself to have a pretty strong stomach so Ive continued eating it with no problem. Unfortunately, this was an unforgettable mistake. Since last night Ive been unable to have a bowel movement, my anal walls clogged to the brim with the chunky salmonturnedexcrement. But it refused to budge, no matter how hard I stressed. 

On my way to class this morning, I got a feeling I can only describe as someone jacking a screwdriver up and down my lower intestine. Without even going to the classroom I knew I needed to use the bathroom. I was in a McGill public bathroom for TWO HOURS, shitting and vomiting on and off. I took turns on the toilet shitting into it and then vomiting in it, ultimately creating a syrupy concoction I can only describe as toxic sludge. It was only after the first hour had I realized that this sludge had oozed onto my backpack, pants, and underwear, sealing my fate for the worst train ride home of my life. My anus still hasnt recovered. I skipped class and Ive been reeling in pain ever since the incident. DO NOT EAT THE RAW SALMON FROM REDPATHS POKE BAR. This isnt the first time Ive shit myself at McGill but its certainly the most traumatic. Youve been warned.

I know this will probably be taken down from being too graphic BUT the student body deserves to know the salmon is NOT fresh and NOT delicious. Im posting this for the safety of other students anuses.

Question couldshould McGill go private??,"Within the context of a hostile Provincial government, which frankly will get worse before it gets better, would it make sense for McGill to become a private university??

Assuming it is legally possible to disentangle from the public system, would McGill be better off?  McGill would no longer be bound by provincial regulations regarding quotas medical professionals, tuition, and financing formulas.  

Based on their 202223 budget document, it appears the Province contributes about 330M annually.  Tuition would need to go up to cover the difference but to what level?

Emailing the McCall MacBain Office,"So Ive been thinking about moving from my current place, which is pretty much just a toilet and a sink meshed together I sleep in the sink. 
Anyways, Im really stressed because since the last time I spoke to you all, I found out that I failed my midterm. Im looking for something that is going to make me fill titillated about life again. As I was walking down Saint Catherine, whiffing up the delectable mixed scents of weed, urine, and rat shit that now comfort me, my eyes laid on the most beautiful building Ive ever seen. It was in this moment that I knew. Something in my heart told me that this is where Im meant to be. I stood in front of the building, googled the address and attended the virtual tour within minutes. The penthouse is what really got me. Shockingly, I found out that it was on sale for  a whopping 3.75 million CAD. Now, I have nothing close to that in my bank account. Not even 0.001 of that. I spent my last 10 on a bubble tea after I failed my exam no more coffee runs for me. 

Now to the main question, Ive heard about this man, a certain McCall MacBain, who fully funds students at McGill. I was telling my momma about him, and she asked why dont you just call McCall up? That really got me thinking. Do you guys think that he could fund my newfound lifestyle? Would he be down for that? Do you think it would hurt to email his office and ask?

The resistance has set a new precedent for the Palestinian struggle  our right to resist the occupation, to defend the land, and to free our prisoners are the utmost priorities.
We call on our people in Montreal and in the far diaspora to celebrate the resistances success, to uplift their calls, and to march this Sunday Oct 8 at 2pm at Dorchester Square

shat my pants in my midterm on thursday and i cant stop thinking about it,"im writing this through tears. i had my first midterm as a university student on thursday and i was so nervous going in. i didnt sleep for 3 days, and was surviving on 4 large coffees from the dep to function. i think the last one really did it for me 

after i got to my exam, i really needed to use the bathroom. But we were not allowed to leave, so I held it all in. by the 10th question, i started leaking some gas. my stomach was gurglin like a witchs boiling cauldron. i know people around me smelled it cz i heard people clearing their throats and chairs scraping super loudly every time a toot slipped through the cracks. I was so embarrassed I started shivering and shaking in my seat. my leg started twitching and thats when it happened.

 at this point there were 15 minutes left. I could feel the warmth I was sitting on and suddenly became hyper aware of my surroundings. As soon as it happened I couldnt help but sit up tall in shock from the discomfort and started looking around to see if anyone noticed. I cant lie my eyes were darting around the entire room. the TA saw me looking around so frantically and approached me whispering about keeping my eyes on my paper, but when they were about 10 feet away they paused and got a bewildered look on their face, and turned up their nose in disgust.

 I felt so shitty and afraid I couldnt even finish my exam. When the time ran out I was glued to my seat. I couldnt get up. So I tried to finish up whatever I could on the exam, as fast as I could. There was a class coming in and the prof and TA were yelling at me to stop writing but I refused to get up. 

At this point the TA stormed over and snatched  my paper and gasped oh my, which prompted another rip of nervousness from me. I burst into tears and kept farting liquid at the same time. I knew that I just had to clench and get out of there as fast as possible. When I got up from my seat, all I could think about was how the hell I was going to grab my sht and get out of there. I was contemplating how to kneel down to get my tote bag without bending over when i saw it. the thickest rear view stripe I have ever see on the seat. I slowly looked up and locked eyes with the TA. I couldnt take it anymore. I just clenched my cheeks for dear life and ran.

I havent been able to sleep soundly since. I am so freaked out and keep having nightmare flashbacks of the TAs face and another one of some poop emoji haunting me.  

do you guys think my TA can forget this? i cant stop thinking about if there was a camera that filmed the whole thing, could TA report me for academic misconduct? I am just a first year and I need help

Speaking My Minds at McGill,"  Im a financially liberal, socially conservative, ambidextrous Poli Sci student. Ive written this post because other students dont feel obligated to indulge in my debate lordiness at McGill. So Im here on Reddit, where I know Ill be accepted.

What Ive realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. No student should ever be made aware of the damage their socially regressive views hold. Its easy not to notice this dogmatism because its all I fucking focus on.

To be clear, Im not a farright wingnut. I just happen to agree with a good portion of their talking points. Im a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. I dont know what these words mean, but Im also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters for their racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia is something Id expect to come from the farright, not leftwing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will generalize to the point of irrelevance in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for. Please whip me harder daddy.

Ive spoken to many lefthanded McGillians who feel they cant speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Dont misunderstand me, they certainly ARE bigots, they just dont want the label. Here are some examples

 Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive, like the emergence of pantsuits as the go to expression for female supremacy.

 Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of selfvictimization and learned helplessness. Soldiers with PTSD, grow the fuck up.

 Black students who disagree with elements of recent antiracist ideas like not being slaves feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students who keep trying to make PSL season a thing.

 Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice. I see you and validate you, trans furry discord nazis.

 Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes. The current approach of course being to support those losers.

 Science students who are alarmed by the antiscientific attitudes of some leftwing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts regarding the field of phrenology. 

 Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but also dont want any pushback on their wildly idiotic takes.

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldnt shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly agreeing with me unconditionally, I realized that at least 6 leftbrained McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but dont feel comfortable saying so without their dad there.

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need ego destroying drugs in order to expand our minds. Listening to Amy Winehouse in reverse while taking a heroic dose of magic mushrooms is a great way to expand our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the those squares wont even let me use the labs to make LSD tabs.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important even though technically no one is stopping me from talking. Its necessary for democracy and good citizenship which is totally not an arbitrary metric. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters for their desire to say the NWord? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society like adults being able to marry their cousins now were controversial a short time ago bring back cousin marriage.

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways, like writing a sentence, with too many fucking, commas. Second firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies like me, you ungrateful assholes. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious and yet is about 90 of the content on my YouTube For You page. It communicates moral arrogance a thing this post DEFINETLY doesnt radiate and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. If minorities in these social justice movements dont suck our dick every time we tolerate them, then whats even the point? There is a reason the farright has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses even though our campuses also are shaming people into not talking about rightwing issues. 

Secondly final, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice. I dont have any examples of this but someone with dyed hair didnt smile at me when I opened a door once. What a feminist.

Im confident that leaving space for disagreement on the humanity of people would allow for the flourishing of groups who historically harmed minorities, create endless debate so we would never actually have to fix material conditions, and strengthen social justice activism which again, Im just guessing would happen. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit me. Lets create a campus where we can speak our minds.

Fuck kids with lupus.

How to avoid telling people my major Music?,"When people ask me what my major and school is, Im hesitant to say. Its probably rare for them to be graced with the presence of a student at the top music school in Canada, the true Harvard of the north. Especially a music major, the most prestigious program at said school. I feel a bit guilty, as meeting someone so much more accomplished, yet their same age, probably crushes their self image.

Speaking Our Minds at McGill," Im a liberal Poli Sci student. Ive written this post because I dont feel like I can speak my mind at McGill. 

What Ive realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. Its easy not to notice this dogmatism because dissent has been discouraged, making some ideas about social justice appear selfevident. 

To be clear, Im not a farright wingnut. Im a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. But Im also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters is something Id expect to come from the farright, not leftwing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will identify in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for.

Ive spoken to many leftwing McGillians who feel they cant speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Here are some examples

 Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive
 Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of selfvictimization and learned helplessness
 Black students who disagree with elements of recent antiracist ideas feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students because they try to acknowledge blackness instead of acting colourblind
 Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice
 Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes
 Science students who are alarmed by the antiscientific attitudes of some leftwing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts that could potentially be abused for rightwing purposes such as existence of human nature and innate aggregate sex differences between men and women
 Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but dont want to be seen as rightwingers

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldnt shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly, I realized that many leftwing McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but dont feel comfortable saying so. 

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need open discourse in order to expand our minds. Listening to the people who disagree with us, instead of assuming they are bigots because we dont like their views, is a great way to sharpen our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the current intellectual environment is robbing many of us of this benefit.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important in itself. Its necessary for democracy and good citizenship. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society now were controversial a short time ago. 

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways. Firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious. It communicates moral arrogance and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. There is a reason the farright has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses. They know that our approach to speech we disagree with is deeply unpopular.

Secondly, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice activism. Activists in this environment become less capable of communicating effectively with the public, since their ideas are tailored to people who already agree with them.

Im confident that leaving space for disagreement would raise the quality of discourse, broaden the minds of students, and strengthen social justice activism. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit all of us. Lets create a campus where we can speak our minds.

So Lonely...,"I am now in my last year at McGill and I have never been more lonely or depressed. In my years now at McGill I have tried joining clubs, volunteering, going to tutorials, talking to people in class but I have yet to make any meaningful friendships let alone even find a significant other. I quite literally go days without saying a word as I have no one to speak to. I came to Montreal and McGill not knowing anyone here beforehand and in my first year covid happened, but I was optimistic every year that it would get better but it never did. Now I am graduating soon and that thought has been so incredibly saddening as people say university is supposed to be the best years of your life, I cant help but feel that I have missed out but at the same time I dont know where I went wrong. Now I am feeling extremely depressed. I hate this perpetual feeling of loneliness, before McGill I took for granted how important friendships are. Its truly horrible, always studying, eating, sitting alone, no one to hang out with. Anyways... sorry for this tangent it just feels so draining always walking around with this ceaseless sadness and having no one to vent to.

frosh needs to go,"Worked as o staff in arts frosh this year... and honestly horrified.

Food 

Ticket prices were over 200 and froshies were only given food at some events. Where they were, the portions were small especially before or after a day of drinking and they werent told they could take seconds. Froshies were not told when they would be given food and what the food was. Also, the gluten free and dairy free options felt like an afterthought. For brunch one day, the gluten free options provided was one orange and a tiny pack of chocolate covered cranberries, while everyone else had bagels with cream cheese. The coords didnt seem to know if the nonmeat options were vegan dairy free. The options were not clearly marked and it seemed like they were guessing.

Transportation 

Transportation was not free and most of the events were pretty far away. A 200 ticket should come with a week long metro pass. Drivesafe was advertised as a reliable option, but when it didnt work, coords told staff and froshies to avoid drive safe as they were severely uinderstaffed. There was a significant not my problem attitude when it came to transportation. A lot of froshies are kids who dont know the city and arent used to public transportation, its not fair to expect them to know what transportation options work or dont. 

Alcohol 

Frosh is notorious for being a rowdy event where alcohol is served but it should not be labeled an orientation. It is basically a drinking week. There were no campus tours or events close to campus. There was a movie night in which arts students were told to go to McMed a science building, not even an arts building. These kids arent even familiar with the campus yet but theyre going into a week of drinking 3 days before classes start. Any event with alcohol becomes about alcohol at frosh. There were chugging games organized by the coords when during training we were told to NEVER encourage chugging. The whole week revolved around alcohol, not seeing campus or the city, or making friends. There was little opportunity for people to talk because most events were at loud clubs.

Accessibility and Inclusivity 

There was little accommodation for froshies that dont drink. If frosh is a drinking week, it should be advertised as such. People showed up regretting spending so much on a ticket just to watch people drink till theyre drunk. There should have been two events at the same time, one with alcohol and one without as not everyone wants to be in that environment. It should not be assumed that everyone is going to drink, therefore nonalcoholic options should be available and advertised. At the bar crawl, people were given 10 minutes to play one chugging drinking game with either water or beer and then made to move to the next bar. 

Golden Rule 

The golden rule for frosh is that you cant have a sexual or intimate relationship with a froshie as a member of staff.

Going out with a bang,"Following uStaiinn s intriguing experiment about pulling an allnighter before a final, I decided to give a it a try After all, what could go wrong, it was only worth 70 of the grade. And I hadnt studied or attended class 2 or 3 times since the midterm. 

And so, armed with 3 dragonfruit flavoured red bulls I began my work in the evening, dutifully reading the online manual, until I got it done around 11pm. I then went over to the PowerPoint slides, and, lo and behold, the chapters had NOTHING to do with the material. Nothing to worry about, I thought innocently, Ive got time. Oh how wrong I was. By 3am, I was a shadow of my former self, harried by viva la vida loca blasting on repeat out of my neighbours window and the voices in my head whispering about Long run average curves, marginal costs and Nuezs game theory for some god forsaken reason. I had been broken, shattered. I stepped in front of the mirror for a little refreshment, and what stared back at me was an unrecognizable mess, sporting a maniacal grin and a tinge of folly in his bloodshot eyes. I felt like Harry Potter discovering his snake speech, except my holy connection was cemented with the much cooler McLennan rats.

And thats when I had my epiphany f it I dont know if I can swear on this sub, Ill just f wing this b. 

And so, with a twisted mind and way too much caffeine flowing through my pulsating veins, I put on the absolute worst drip possible old blue and greasy sweatpants and a red team Canada hoodie, crowned with a cap to hide my warcrime of a hairdo walking up to the sports complex I felt reborn, unstoppable, RISE by mako tearing my eardrums to shreds in the process. 

Sat down, grabbed my pencil with the might of god himself, and ABSOLUTELY. FUCKING. DESTROYED. that exam. SUPLEXED. ROUNDHOUSE KICKED IN THE GONADS IF YOU WILL.

NEW SUMMER, NEW ME BABY. MAKE LIFE YOUR B, MCGILLIANS. I KNOW YOUVE GOT THAT DAWG IN YOU. DONT GIVE UP. IF A DUMBASS LIKE ME CAN LEARN AN ENTIRE CLASS WORTH OF CONTENT HIGH ON CAFFEINE YOU CAN RULE THIS DAMN PLANET.

I must thank uStaiinn for showing me this holy path and also for making me lose a lot of neurons, which Ill probably never recover.

Final examclass too easy?,"If 70 of the class is getting between 95100 in the class and the average on the final is 92... is the class too easy?

The material for this class honours math was in no way simple but the extremely generous grading schemes at every step of the way and having an openbook final at closedbook difficulty with a maximum is 6080 grading scheme makes for some pretty outrageous numbers...

Like Im not going to complain, Ill take the A, but to literally get a perfect 100 in a class feels weird and ultimately I dont feel like I deserve that.

What do you think about the name of McGill  does this name indeed created a unwelcoming atmosphere for minorities?,"Hello everyone! I saw this everywhere on various medias today and I am wondering how everyones thought about this. 

It seems that the name McGill has been dropped out of a student newspaper I have never heard of beforeat McGill called McGill Tribune, because James McGill owned slaves and this name created a systemic discrimination environment to the minorities especially black and indigenous people.

The papers editorial board made the decision because it didnt want to continue honouring someone who enslaved Black and Indigenous people and they promote that the university should no longer use the name McGill either.

Madison EdwardWright, a managing editor at The Tribune says We dont feel that the legacy of James McGill is something that we can continue to have appear on our paper, on our masthead. Its not something that we think aligns with our values as journalists and as an institution that works to voice the concerns of students.

What do you think about this? I am one who promotes the concept of EDI very much, and I am trying to involve myself in promoting EDI at McGill. I am also dreaming of creating a more inclusive environment for people in McGill community, just like what the editors thought and did. This post is solely asking how everyone feel about the name  do you feel uncomfortable saying you are a McGill student? Personally, as one of the visible minorities, I have no issue with this.

Wanting to Help Two Women Students? Ticketed at Sherbrooke Metro,"This may be a long shot, but

Today, around 18h15 at Sherbrooke Metro, I saw two young women getting ticketed. I believe they were both East Asian, and they looked, ostensibly, like McGill students schoolrelated attire.

It reminded me of when I was also ticketed as a firstyear student, having accidentally dropped my Metro ticket. I distinctly recall the fine as being 221, which, as a broke student, was over my total monthly grocery budget. I was enormously stressed, lived off of riceandbeans for weeks, borrowed money from friends.

Despite explaining the situation to the officers, having them literally speak to the Metro agent who sold me my ticket, and seeking help from the Legal Information Clinic, I learned that the onus remains for the person riding public transit to keep, on their persons, their physical ticket, for the entire duration of the trip. Accidentally dropping it has no impact on this law, even with testimony from the person who sold it.

Im no longer a broke undergrad, but wouldnt wish this happen to anyone. If this was your situationthat you either dropped your tickets, or did not know of this stipulation in Montreal transit lawId like to offer to defray the cost of the fine. Being a student is stressful enough asis, and nobody should be punished with such a disproportionately heavy fine, if by ignorance, or honest mistake.

Im hoping this Hail Mary attempt will reach the two people affected. I ask that you simply provide proof both of who you are, and that the situation that you had earnestly purchased tickets, and either threw them away, or accidentally dropped them was an honest mistake.

Thank you, and hoping everyone had a restful weekend!",1680479706,181,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/12a2ucp/wanting_to_help_two_women_students_ticketed_at/,12,overlyspicyhotsauce,12a2ucp,4/2/2023 23:55,"['may', 'long', 'shot', 'today', 'around', 'h', 'sherbrooke', 'metro', 'saw', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'getting', 'ticketed.', 'believe', 'east', 'asian', 'looked', 'ostensibly', 'like', 'mcgill', 'students', 'schoolrelated', 'attire.', 'reminded', 'also', 'ticketed', 'firstyear', 'student', 'accidentally', 'dropped', 'metro', 'ticket.', 'distinctly', 'recall', 'fine', 'broke', 'student', 'total', 'monthly', 'grocery', 'budget.', 'enormously', 'stressed', 'lived', 'riceandbeans', 'weeks', 'borrowed', 'money', 'friends.', 'despite', 'explaining', 'situation', 'officers', 'literally', 'speak', 'metro', 'agent', 'sold', 'ticket', 'seeking', 'help', 'legal', 'information', 'clinic', 'learned', 'onus', 'remains', 'person', 'riding', 'public', 'transit', 'keep', 'persons', 'physical', 'ticket', 'entire', 'duration', 'trip.', 'accidentally', 'dropping', 'impact', 'law', 'even', 'testimony', 'person', 'sold', 'it.', 'im', 'longer', 'broke', 'undergrad', 'wouldnt', 'wish', 'happen', 'anyone.', 'situationthat', 'either', 'dropped', 'tickets', 'know', 'stipulation', 'montreal', 'transit', 'lawid', 'like', 'offer', 'defray', 'cost', 'fine.', 'student', 'stressful', 'enough', 'asis', 'nobody', 'punished', 'disproportionately', 'heavy', 'fine', 'ignorance', 'honest', 'mistake.', 'im', 'hoping', 'hail', 'mary', 'attempt', 'reach', 'two', 'people', 'affected.', 'ask', 'simply', 'provide', 'proof', 'situation', 'earnestly', 'purchased', 'tickets', 'either', 'threw', 'away', 'accidentally', 'dropped', 'honest', 'mistake.', 'thank', 'hoping', 'everyone', 'restful', 'weekend!']",1,0,0,0

Ramadan Kareem ,"As today marks the beginning of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, I wanted to take a moment to introduce those who may not be familiar with the traditions and culture surrounding this special time.

During this month, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset as a way of practicing selfdiscipline and reflecting on their faith. Additionally, Ramadan is a time for remembering the less fortunate and giving to charity.

While many families typically break their fast together at sunset, it can be difficult for students who may not live close to their families. Thats why many mosques, including CIIC and Almadinah, offer free food for the next 30 days to those who are fasting.

To our Muslim friends and community members, I want to extend my congratulations and wish you a blessed Ramadan. May Allah accept your fasting and prayers .

How is this ok?

Students that are already strapped for money, after paying for a place to live, paying for tuition, books, supplies, computers, parking, travel, and all the rest of it, being forced to pay many thousands extra over and beyond for highly overpriced food?

Students are forced to pay for a card such that you can start spending on food to the universitys liking and priced the way they feel they can get away with. All on the backs of the already cash strapped students.

And who are these restaurants owned by? Someone from the Ozarks?

Rant Rant Rant,"Idk how u guys do it tbh...

Its my 2nd semester, I hate my major with a passion . Ive been thinking of changing programs. At this point idc what im studying, im here for the money. I have no motivation going to lectures let alone studying for a career that makes 50k... I am here for the money. Anything remotely interesting that generates money. IDC WHAT IT IS.

I spent my reading week procrastinating, the past 3 days Ive been cramping up lectures for a midterm on tuesday. And let me tell you this, I hated every second of it.  Im seriously considering dropping out, as I found other training opportunity with a far better compensation in the future. Main plan was go to mcgill become a dentist. After a little calculations turns out, If i was to get accepted, I would start working at the age of 30... at the age of 30.......

I need something, pls, enlighten me with reasons to stay in uni. Any reason.

Frankly,  after making an quite the amount of money for 2 months on a side thing a year back... I cant stop thinking why we get so little compensation after that much studying. At this point I look at uni and tell myself that its worth it only if youre going in meddent or law. Sure business, engineering etc you make money, but once you gather the sufficient experience. After a little research I come to find out the average yearly salary in Canada is 61k.... I dont see how 61k is enough to live a comfortable life.

P.S I dont come from a rich family, Ive just had quite the experiences with money, Ive met and talked to quite a lot of impressive people, Ive had the taste of money, and Im not talking about working a minimum salary job over the summer. I just dont see how uni would help me achieve the life I want.

All this rant was to say, once again.. Please, give me a reason to stay in uni, any valid reason that would change my way of thinking...

Anyways, back to phgy we go, thanks for reading!

"SMMU removed grammarly, udemy,  calm?","Edit
Thank you for all the unexpected interactions this got! 

Many of you agreed with what I was saying, and some didnt. This post mentions some things to do to be heard by those representing us and talks about the shady past some of you brought up

httpswww.reddit.comrmcgillcomments112oibtstudentsupportfee



I just read my email and found that the services that we got this year, grammarly udemy and calm, are being removed? This really annoyed me, its been months of me using it and thought it would be here till the end of my degree. The fee was more than worth it for what we got in return.

Does anyone know why SMMU Council decided not to give us the services again? Literally me and everyone I know is using atleast one of the services if not more. Udemy and grammarly are huge life savors, they helped me prepare for class much better than ever before. Even calm I began to use regularly to help me sleep.

It just seems weird that they these services came and went so quickly? I am sure I am not the only one who has built some sort of dependency on the service.

I just wish we at least have the option to use the services and not it being taken away from our hands just like that. Is there anything we can do to keep Student Support and their services?

Watch SMMU then introduce it later on for a higher price without Student Support. There is a clear demand for this, as I said every student I know is using atleast one of these services

"Beware, creep spotted on Cybertech of MclennanRedpath Complex.","Throwaway because of context

On January 10th, I noticed a guy walking around the library but unlike the rest of the people walking around, he had no purpose to his walk he wasnt going to get something from the cafe or going to fill up his water bottle like the rest of the people walking around. He clearly was not trying to study, instead he was just loitering. I didnt think too much about it and continued working for a bit until I was ready to leave. As I was walking out of Cybertech I saw him talking to one of my past lab partners. I was going to just leave but I got a terrible feeling and turned around. After joining the conversation for a few minutes, it was quickly established that he was a complete stranger to her. I proceeded to ask her to go eat with me to which she agreed. Once he left she thanked me profusely, explaining that he had approached her super creepily saying things to the tune of Wow, you look like a dream. That day, I regretted not being able to take a photo of him and report him.

About a week later, on January 23rd, I walked back into Cybertech to study and froze when I saw him standing over yet another girl. I approached them and sat nearby to monitor the situation I wanted to be relatively sure that they were not friends before I intervened. I tried to make eye contact with her so I could see if she needed me to intervene. After about two minutes, he asked her to leave with him to which she declined. Thankfully he left after that. All the girls nearby, including myself, promptly turned around to ask if she was ok. This time I did my best to get a photo of him. I reported him to the library but obviously as he had already left there wasnt much they could do besides promise to try to increase security presence in Cybertech.

I am not able to post pictures of him legally but his general description is a mid 20s relatively tall male with very long black, frizzy hair both times in a ponytail, olive skin tone, medium build on the skinnier side, stubble bit of a moustache, dark eyes, so everyone knows what he looks like. I do not think that he even goes to McGill. The first time I saw him and interrupted the conversation he introduced himself to me as Louis. Cybertech is his hunting ground, he is looking for girls who are sitting alone. If you see him, report him to security. More than this if you see him talking to a girl, please please please try to at least check on her to make sure shes alright, because you may end up saving her. Odds are she is not a willing participant in that conversation. I cant tell you how many times I have wished someone would help me in these situations, predation is an issue that must be addressed, it is not a joke. Please do your part.

Do you need to be here inperson even when attending online classes?,"This might not make sense, but I have recently been emailed by McGill regarding this fact. I am unsure about how this is an actual requirement? This seems like an unreal stipulation and sounds awfully contrived.

I cannot find anything about this on official McGill websites, nor do I think did anyone else have this problem.

The McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism is hosting a transphobic lawyer from the UK as a speaker on the subject of The Gender Debate,"The CHRLP is hosting a talk from transphobic lawyer and LGB Alliance advocate Robert Wintemute this coming Tuesday. For those that dont know, the LGB Alliance is a UKbased organisation that advocates against trans rights, framing the existence of trans people as a danger to gay people hence the acronym, LGB without the T, as well as to women and children. The organisation has lobbied against gender affirming care and against bans on conversion therapy in the UK, and is widely described by UK politicians and activists as a hate group. 

By framing the topic of transgender rights and equality as a gender debate, the CHRLP is opening the door to denial of our rights being seen as a reasonable position to take on a current political issue, instead of what it is transphobic bigotry that goes against the values of equal rights for all. If McGill allows this to go forward, it could potentially contribute to creating a hostile and unwelcome environment for trans and gender nonconforming people in the community, which is a scary prospect at a time when transphobia is on the rise globally. Its the universitys duty to foster an environment where no student feels unsafe or discriminated against, and platforming this hateful extremist does exactly the opposite. McGill University and its affiliated groups such as the CHRLP owe it to the trans student body to protect us from bigoted ideologies and hate groups that seek to target us, undermine our identities, attack our reallife gender nonconformity, and turn public opinion against us, oftentimes with violent intent. 

What we are going to do

A protest is going to take place on this Tuesday, January 10th, at 1240, in Room 16 at Chancellor Day Hall. I really encourage everyone who wants to do something about this to come to the protest, bring signs, come to show your support as much as possible. 

Of course not everyone wants to or is able to attend a protest in the middle of a school day, but if you still want to show support, were calling on everyone who is willing to send an email of protest to the members of the CHRLP and the Faculty of Law who are organising and enabling this event to take place.

lit classes always triggering?,"after this term I never want to take another literature class again. The themes are just too much.

Its not like Im a women studies major with the stomach to study this stuff, I was hoping to read at least some books that wouldnt be incredibly triggering.

whenever i wanna be closer to him as in creating a friendship after class, he kinda shied away. i felt like we hit it off smoothly but he didnt wanna be more than friends in class. thats so sad for me  maybe hes already got his friend circle. maybe im overthinking cuz i never asked him out to hang out together for fear of him thinking i was trying to hit on him when i wasnt.

"Chinese nationales whos a McGill students, please be cautious protesting or even talking shit about CCP on campus out loud","Disclaimer I am not discouraging people that they should not protest, or not to voice your opinion. They are completely legal and okay in Canada. However, be cautious, as the Chinese government dont play by the rule, and if things go wrong your family could be threatened. In fact, I am a part of many antiChina events myself. 

Hello there, I just want to send a reminder to all the Chinese international students I am only talking about those who has Chinese nationality while having family in China, and the family isnt a part of the government or being powerful or being really rich, its not very safe to talk shit about the CCP in public out loud in public, for the following reasons

The CSSA, Chinese Students and Scholars Association, is actually a very Chinesegovernment related organization as they are partner with the embassy, and they receive fund from the Chinese government for various activities. There is no guaranty that you would not be taken photo and illegally surveilled by some of them while protesting or even just simply talking shit about the CCP and get reported to the embassy. However, there are high chance your family will get in trouble IF you really get reported to the embassy and the Chinese PD.

One very recent example of the CSSA act on behalf of the good of the CCP happens on October 27, 2022, which is like a month ago when Xi secured his position. Carnegie Mellon University, a wellknown university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. There was an unofficial, although recognized by the university, university billboard, called the Fence. It could be painted by students freely and the message usually stay there. The Fence was painted with slogans against the CCP and Xi. However, the CSSA of CMU was informed by the consulate of the region that it could be bad for the CCPs reputation and could bring student so calledfalse interpretations of the Chinese government. Therefore, the CSSA of CMU painted The Fence in white over night and the slogans only stayed there for a mere one day. Because of this event, it is hard to tell whether the CSSA would do what I stated in the paragraph. 

By the way, there are really a lot of crazy supporters of the CCP whos at the mean time an international student in Canada. The most notorious one being the armoured guy from York University who claims threats to destroy everyone who puts poster against his country back in October. It is hard to say if there could be one like them reporting you to the embassy or to the Overseas Chinese Police Station, or just put your life in danger directly. THEREFORE, MY FELLOW CHINESE STUDENTS, BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT LUNATICS AND THE CCP WHILE PROTESTING AND TALKING SHIT ABOUT THE CCP.

Finally, I want to point out that there were a lot of reallife examples of Chinese nationals home to a foreign country protesting in their country of residency, and the students family being investigated and harassed by the Chinese government. A close family friend s son was a student of Hong Kong University, and his a part of the protest in HK in 2019. He was later expelled from the school, deported from Hong Kong, and imprisoned after being transported back to China. Also, his family was under heavy surveillance since then and often harassed by the local PD. I know we are not in Hong Kong, but there are recently several so called Chinese overseas police stations created here in Canada. Although it could be hearsay, but it is best to protest ourselves.

An honest confession,"Im graduating, and I got a job waiting for me, but I have to get this off my chest as a former Teaching Assistant to all the students especially continuing studies.

1. We are students just like you. 
2. You dont own us. You cant say whatever pops into your head and harass us.
3. You cant email us at 1230 am and tell us what to do with harsh language and expect a fast response. 
4. Stop being so entitled. Every TA I know is a student who wants to support their studies cause of a lack of financials, so understand them.

It really bothered me during my time here and broke my heart so many times, and I couldnt tell anyone or respond to the students the way I wanted. Im talking to those from Continuing studies that McGill has no filter of their background. Just because youre older, doesnt mean you can mistreat and harass us.

Roofied  TRH Bar,"This weekend I went to Trash Bar on Saint Laurent with a few friends to grab a drink. I had one drink and drank it while we watched some people skating. Roughly an hour later one of my friends had a very intense dizzy spell and decided to call a cab, chocking it up to being the fault of her dab pen. 45 minutes later I collapsed unconcious waiting in line on the stairs at coat check. I dont know how long I was unconcious for but when I came to I was unable to speak and could barely see. I hit my head when I fell and got pretty bangedbruised, and I couldnt speak coherently until I was able to throw up. Luckily my friends found me quickly, but I want to make sure I share this because this was a very frightening experience and I imagine that whoever is orchestrating this is waiting until a person gets caught without their friends in a less visible area. The only way that my friend and Is drink could have been tampered with is if someone slipped it in while sliding past us, or if it came directly from the bartender herself. Be careful guys, watching your drink isnt always enough.

Should vending machines be allowed on campus?,"Here is my hot take vending machines should not be allowed on campus, or at least discouraged. 

I think one of the low hanging fruits of leading a healthy lifestyle on and off campus is healthy eating. For instance, when Im getting absolutely abused by midterms, as most of us just went through, I make it a priority to eat healthily. This is because I know the immense difference eating makes not only on your physical health, but also on your mental health. During these stressful times it becomes especially important to eat well.  

I am further reminded that I am nothing more than a  sign when I walk past these machines filled with garbage. There is literally no other reason for McGill to put vending machines on campus other then to squeeze university students by virtue of the indifference that many students feel towards healthy eating at this point. This place doesnt give a sht about your health. If they did, they would at least offer healthier options in the vending machines. 

Listen, I know everyone here is an adult and can make their own choices about what they eat, I just think that this school has a responsibility to foster an environment that encourages people to make healthy choices. Especially during a time where it has become increasingly clear that noncommunicable diseases place a massive burden on our healthcare system. Not to mention that cardiovascular health is the leading cause of death in the world!!!!

Being a Furry at McGill,"Wondering if anyone else can relate to this. Probably more relatable for men than for women. Being a furry at McGill sucks so bad. Professors will straight up say rude things about furries in there classes and its like hello??? I am right here In my Triple XL Rainbow Fox Furry Suit!!! People dont want to work on group projects with you, they automatically assume youre a freak, they dont want to get to know you. I am not even talking about in a dating context if I have my furry con photos on tinder, I get crucified. It is SO hard to make friends as a Furry here!!! I feel extremely ostracized at this school. Of course these are issues you face everywhere as a furry but I feel like they are so amplified here. Definitely doesnt help to be in this population of extremely hot and fashionable students that dont have permanent sweat ingrained in their hair from their unwashed furry suits.

Please dont leave any comments telling me this is in my head or that everyone has trouble make friends here. If you are not a male furry you have no idea what you are talking about.

PSA keep an eye on your stuff on campus,"Was in a lecture this morning Macdonald Engineering working on a group activity. A girl sitting close to the door had her phone on her table but was working with the people behind her so she was completely turned around, couldnt see her phone. A random man with a pink backpack entered the room it was quite noisy since everyone was working together so no one paid attention to him. He calmly grabbed the phone and walked out very calmly, like it was his. Luckily a few people told the girl and she ran out after him she was able to get the phone back apparently he just handed it to her and left. 
No one else noticed this except me and maybe 3 other people the lecture went on as usual as the prof didnt notice anything.

I guess this serves as a PSA to keep an eye on your stuff, even in the lecture halls.

Getting involved in school spirit and Campus Culture,"Ive noticed at McGill so far that there seems to be a lack of school spirit like schools in the States. Cant seem to find many people who are enthusiastic about the sports team at McGill or wearing university merch around.

it gets better,"hi! im a third year student who up until today pretty much hated their time at mcgill. my first year i was super depressed, in a really really bad mental health place. i had pretty much no friends or barely hung out with them because they lived off campus or at other rezs. school stressed me out significantly. i missed my support system  felt super isolated especially during the cold winter months. unlike many, when i found out in march 2020 i could go home  i was so happy. i couldnt stand it here. i was even more happy when i found out i could spend a whole year at home. while i enjoyed being at home  last year brought its own set of challenges particularly in burning me out. staring at a screen for days on end made me feel so disconnected. most of my profs only showed their hands writing on whiteboards on a recorded lecture. i kept thinking to myself, why did i decide on mcgill? why was it my dream school? when last year ended  it was a sigh of relief. i decided last year in may that this wasnt going to be my life anymore. i was going to finally start making the most of my experience. so what did i do? i joined clubs, where i met great people which led to making more friends. i joined intramural teams bc i always loved playing sports and being active helped my mental health. i actually starting participating in class. sure, i still sit in the back but i engage with the lectures and discussions. for someone with social anxiety, scared of being judged this was huge for me  this semester was the first one at mcgill where all my profs knew my name and who i was. its led to better grades, better relationships, learning more about the city and going out. so when my profs yesterday and today said thank you for a great semester. its been a pleasure. have a great summer i felt sadness  because it was over. its crazy to believe that ill be in my last year in the fall. but, im so excited for the new memories and experiences im sure to have. 

x200B

so to go back to my point of why i decided on mcgill. well, its been hell. its had more downs than ups. but i know for a fact that i will graduate a better person, that is more secure and more confident than i came coming in  for that im extremely grateful.

for anyone who is struggling to feel that they belong at this school  it is never too late.

How inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible do you have to be to show up to class if youre clearly sick and symptomatic? I understand that this class essentially has mandatory attendance. But do you realize that its mandatory for every student in this class??! Even for students who arent sick and dont want to get sick and for those who cannot afford to get sick?!?!

How about staying the fuck home, and letting one of your healthy friends come in for you and sending you their notes? 

Or how come there isnt a program like OSD note taking, but for COVIDsick students to enroll in temporarily? I mean, if youre sick, Id even offer to share my notes with you, but if Ill have to keep sitting in a crowd of sick people, I will stop going to lectures from now on. 

But for those of you who are sick, and showing up to class, consider this exam season is approaching. This is not a time when responsible students who take precautions and who are COVID negative can afford to get sick. Im sorry that you are, and I hope that you get better soon.

Is McGill Admin Threatening to Kill SSMU?,"Im sure everyone interested in these topics has read their email.

The McGill Administration is threatening to terminate the memorandum of agreementhttpswww.mcgill.castudentlifeandlearningfilesstudentlifeandlearningmay312024.pdf between SSMU and the University should SSMU not immediately abandon its democratically decided upon Palestine Solidarity Policyhttpsdocs.google.comdocumentd1drVfxAnCjS8mwDuzDrY85y62PXmIdU2XgUz17qOa0edit.

From what I understand, this memorandum essentially outlines the relationship between the University and the Students Union. This, and feel free to correct me if Im wrong, is where a lot of SSMUs power is derived from.

I think its possible to discuss the merits of the Palestine policy. I, for one, am in favour of it. Be that as it may, the key part of the email is as follows

As Deputy Provost, I have communicated these concerns to the SSMU leadership and advised them to take prompt and appropriate remedial action, consistent with SSMUs obligations under its Memorandum of Agreement with the University, failing which the University will terminate this Memorandum of Agreement.

Say what you will about SSMU, but this is an affront to the slim amount of democracy we as students are entitled to here at McGill. Im not impressed by the administrations attempt at overreach.

Im interested to hear other opinions on the matter.

Yet another sad story from an intl grad student,"Here is my sad story as a grad student at McGill  maybe other international students might get something out of it. Apologies for the very negative tone.

Context Im an international student from one of those developing countries out there, as people here told me once. I completed my undergrad and had to go to the industry for a few years into STEM. Then I got an MSc, published a paper and started to prepare an application for McGills PhD program. I made it! I joined a lab I deeply admired.

As I moved to Montreal and started my semester, I realized some things would be harder than I expected covid was not here yet Id have 3 years to take 8 grad courses, TA every semester to make 630 CAD and my tuition fees were not covered. The stipend I got later 25K would be nearly entirely for the tuition fees 23K. I thought I could keep a part time job on top of this workload. Heh.

Red flags for the lab came fast the week I arrived, another grad student was leaving McGill after a severe discussion with the PI it was all before covid. Then the pandemic hit us all, and, while losing relatives and friends without being able to travel anywhere, I went over multiple unpleasant events at the lab ppl yelling at me multiple times, being targeted with racist jokes, etc. The worst part is that I was not allowed to do research on the topic I wanted. Claiming I was intellectually limited, prof assigned me to a project which was not under they domain, but they had to publish to meet the requirements of a grant. I was not allowed to have collaborators outside my lab. Anyway, this post is not about this problematic behaviour of this lab.

It took me time to leave. I finally made it out in my 3rd semester. I thought the department would be supportive, but no. They gave me a deadline to find another supervisor. Id also be forced to switch areas entirely. Sadly, I did not find any other prof to support me through the PhD. The department kindly reminded Id be kicked out and Id need to leave the country. In the middle of a pandemic. Youll need to go back home, they said. I dont have a home anywhere else. Without other options, I had to leave the PhD program and switch to the MSc program  and continue paying these bloody tuition fees.

To bring some light to this sad narrative, I ended up joining a lab where the prof allowed me to do research on the topic I wanted to, even though its not their area of expertise. Even though I have no labmates, nor ppl to talk to, I am still very thankful for the opportunity they gave me. This was one of my very few nice experiences here.

From the last paragraph, you may think this is yet another story with a happy conclusion. It isnt. My dream to pursue a PhD in this domain is dead my records got dirty after leaving a PhD program other institutions wont take me. Plus, its a relatively small community and people know my previous advisor. McGill took away my confidence, energy and money I understand the pandemic made everything worse. Now, there is a war we dont have a moment to breathe, eh?.

International students watch out, especially if you didnt complete your undergrad here. The work load is unsustainable 8 courses you may get a course reduction in some cases I did and went from 8 courses to 7, 3 years to complete your PhD that was fixed on my letter, 25K stipend not covering your intl tuition fees, TAing every semester for 630 CAD... There are some scholarship opportunities I got one from the department for my 3rd semester, but then I had to leave the program as I described previously, but they are far more limited. Working offcampus is challenging, since were limited to 20h. Many companies wont take parttime very true for some branches of STEM.

Also, do not let people treat you poorly just because of the place you come from. And dont rely on the administration either. They may not help at all.

I had no friends around. I still dont everyone is much younger than me. My only support came from the therapists at McGill. 

Lastly, Im sharing this story because I found out other students are going through similar issues. I am sorry. If anyone is in the same boat, reach out.

I am glad this all is coming to an end.",1646757887,167,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/t9l04w/yet_another_sad_story_from_an_intl_grad_student/,41,egalois20,t9l04w,3/8/2022 16:44,"['sad', 'story', 'grad', 'student', 'mcgill', 'maybe', 'international', 'students', 'might', 'get', 'something', 'it.', 'apologies', 'negative', 'tone.', 'context', 'im', 'international', 'student', 'one', 'developing', 'countries', 'people', 'told', 'once.', 'completed', 'undergrad', 'go', 'industry', 'years', 'stem.', 'got', 'msc', 'published', 'paper', 'started', 'prepare', 'application', 'mcgills', 'phd', 'program.', 'made', 'it!', 'joined', 'lab', 'deeply', 'admired.', 'moved', 'montreal', 'started', 'semester', 'realized', 'things', 'would', 'harder', 'expected', 'covid', 'yet', 'id', 'years', 'take', 'grad', 'courses', 'ta', 'every', 'semester', 'make', 'cad', 'tuition', 'fees', 'covered.', 'stipend', 'got', 'later', 'k', 'would', 'nearly', 'entirely', 'tuition', 'fees', 'k.', 'thought', 'could', 'keep', 'part', 'time', 'job', 'top', 'workload.', 'heh.', 'red', 'flags', 'lab', 'came', 'fast', 'week', 'arrived', 'another', 'grad', 'student', 'leaving', 'mcgill', 'severe', 'discussion', 'pi', 'covid.', 'pandemic', 'hit', 'us', 'losing', 'relatives', 'friends', 'without', 'able', 'travel', 'anywhere', 'went', 'multiple', 'unpleasant', 'events', 'lab', 'ppl', 'yelling', 'multiple', 'times', 'targeted', 'racist', 'jokes', 'etc.', 'worst', 'part', 'allowed', 'research', 'topic', 'wanted.', 'claiming', 'intellectually', 'limited', 'prof', 'assigned', 'project', 'domain', 'publish', 'meet', 'requirements', 'grant.', 'allowed', 'collaborators', 'outside', 'lab.', 'anyway', 'post', 'problematic', 'behaviour', 'lab.', 'took', 'time', 'leave.', 'finally', 'made', 'rd', 'semester.', 'thought', 'department', 'would', 'supportive', 'no.', 'gave', 'deadline', 'find', 'another', 'supervisor.', 'id', 'also', 'forced', 'switch', 'areas', 'entirely.', 'sadly', 'find', 'prof', 'support', 'phd.', 'department', 'kindly', 'reminded', 'id', 'kicked', 'id', 'need', 'leave', 'country.', 'middle', 'pandemic.', 'youll', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'said.', 'dont', 'home', 'anywhere', 'else.', 'without', 'options', 'leave', 'phd', 'program', 'switch', 'msc', 'program', 'continue', 'paying', 'bloody', 'tuition', 'fees.', 'bring', 'light', 'sad', 'narrative', 'ended', 'joining', 'lab', 'prof', 'allowed', 'research', 'topic', 'wanted', 'even', 'though', 'area', 'expertise.', 'even', 'though', 'labmates', 'ppl', 'talk', 'still', 'thankful', 'opportunity', 'gave', 'me.', 'one', 'nice', 'experiences', 'here.', 'last', 'paragraph', 'may', 'think', 'yet', 'another', 'story', 'happy', 'conclusion.', 'isnt.', 'dream', 'pursue', 'phd', 'domain', 'dead', 'records', 'got', 'dirty', 'leaving', 'phd', 'program', 'institutions', 'wont', 'take', 'me.', 'plus', 'relatively', 'small', 'community', 'people', 'know', 'previous', 'advisor.', 'mcgill', 'took', 'away', 'confidence', 'energy', 'money', 'understand', 'pandemic', 'made', 'everything', 'worse.', 'war', 'dont', 'moment', 'breathe', 'eh?.', 'international', 'students', 'watch', 'especially', 'didnt', 'complete', 'undergrad', 'here.', 'work', 'load', 'unsustainable', 'courses', 'may', 'get', 'course', 'reduction', 'cases', 'went', 'courses', 'years', 'complete', 'phd', 'fixed', 'letter', 'k', 'stipend', 'covering', 'intl', 'tuition', 'fees', 'taing', 'every', 'semester', 'cad...', 'scholarship', 'opportunities', 'got', 'one', 'department', 'rd', 'semester', 'leave', 'program', 'described', 'previously', 'far', 'limited.', 'working', 'offcampus', 'challenging', 'since', 'limited', 'h.', 'many', 'companies', 'wont', 'take', 'parttime', 'true', 'branches', 'stem.', 'also', 'let', 'people', 'treat', 'poorly', 'place', 'come', 'from.', 'dont', 'rely', 'administration', 'either.', 'may', 'help', 'all.', 'friends', 'around.', 'still', 'dont', 'everyone', 'much', 'younger', 'me.', 'support', 'came', 'therapists', 'mcgill.', 'lastly', 'im', 'sharing', 'story', 'found', 'students', 'going', 'similar', 'issues.', 'sorry.', 'anyone', 'boat', 'reach', 'out.', 'glad', 'coming', 'end.']",1,0,0,0

SSMU silence on Ukraine,"As Im sure everyone has noticed, Big Suze has just issued a statement on the situation in Ukraine, nearly a week after the beginning of the conflict. This is not an unusual delay for McGill admin. However, the silence of SSMU in the meantime is extremely uncharacteristic and raises some questions about their priorities.

Im aware that many students would rather SSMU not take political stances at all. Im also aware that SSMU execs have their own political priorities. However, surely they understand that when they have a history of reacting within a day or two to world issues with positions that end up being controversial or outright reviled by the student body, yet remain silent for nearly a week on an issue as clearcut as Ukraine, it only draws attention to how out of touch they are with the views of the student body and calls into question their priorities. If this is the beginning of a SSMU abstention from commenting on political issues, Im sure many would welcome it, but to begin with this issue in particular is extremely suspect. 

I also understand that SSMU is currently wrapped up in its own drama, but with the homeland of some students under attack and the homelands of many more under threat, it is terrible optics for them to be focusing instead on petty internal squabbling.

I know this is not a massive surprise or a particularly pressing issue compared to the many better things to worry about surrounding the Ukraine conflict, but I feel its important to draw attention to this silence regardless.",1646248165,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/t57lw3/ssmu_silence_on_ukraine/,25,BenJDavis,t57lw3,3/2/2022 19:09,"['im', 'sure', 'everyone', 'noticed', 'big', 'suze', 'issued', 'statement', 'situation', 'ukraine', 'nearly', 'week', 'beginning', 'conflict.', 'unusual', 'delay', 'mcgill', 'admin.', 'however', 'silence', 'ssmu', 'meantime', 'extremely', 'uncharacteristic', 'raises', 'questions', 'priorities.', 'im', 'aware', 'many', 'students', 'would', 'rather', 'ssmu', 'take', 'political', 'stances', 'all.', 'im', 'also', 'aware', 'ssmu', 'execs', 'political', 'priorities.', 'however', 'surely', 'understand', 'history', 'reacting', 'within', 'day', 'two', 'world', 'issues', 'positions', 'end', 'controversial', 'outright', 'reviled', 'student', 'body', 'yet', 'remain', 'silent', 'nearly', 'week', 'issue', 'clearcut', 'ukraine', 'draws', 'attention', 'touch', 'views', 'student', 'body', 'calls', 'question', 'priorities.', 'beginning', 'ssmu', 'abstention', 'commenting', 'political', 'issues', 'im', 'sure', 'many', 'would', 'welcome', 'begin', 'issue', 'particular', 'extremely', 'suspect.', 'also', 'understand', 'ssmu', 'currently', 'wrapped', 'drama', 'homeland', 'students', 'attack', 'homelands', 'many', 'threat', 'terrible', 'optics', 'focusing', 'instead', 'petty', 'internal', 'squabbling.', 'know', 'massive', 'surprise', 'particularly', 'pressing', 'issue', 'compared', 'many', 'better', 'things', 'worry', 'surrounding', 'ukraine', 'conflict', 'feel', 'important', 'draw', 'attention', 'silence', 'regardless.']",1,1,0,0

Are first years getting more rude or am I getting more old,"Another post on here pointed this out a while ago but I feel like Zoom has really made us lose basic classroom etiquette. Weve already talked about first years flooding the chats with side conversation and questions that can easily be answered by looking at the syllabus, but Im also starting to feel it in in person classes too. Students will be loudly packing up and talking to their friends while the prof is still talking and it makes me so sad for the prof who is probably too nice to call them out. I always wait until theyre done to pack up as was always the norm but I feel like Im in the minority now.

Its genuinely making me miss the days when profs would call students out in a 600 person lecture for not looking at the syllabus before raising their hand or for talking to their friend in the back of the class this happened in a Leacock 132 class my first year and it was iconic. Please comfort me and tell me some profs still enforce this and my class is just an anomaly. Also, for anyone who does these things, its driving me crazy and I need you to stop.

Why is SSMU opposing the return to inperson classes?,"Once again, it seems that SSMU has put out a statement encouraging the McGill administration to take on a specific action this time its delaying the return to inperson classes WITHOUT ACTUALLY CONSULTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS. Yes, SSMU is elected by the students to represent the student body but, in such serious situations such as the return to inperson classes, one would think that the SSMU executives would value the opinions of their constituents.

The SSMU executives should have held a meeting, an assembly of sorts, to allow those concerned with such important decisions such as this one to voice their opinions so that they could draft a policy made for the benefit of everyone.

Specifically, SSMUs decision to just blatantly oppose the return to inperson activities is completely ignorant to the very serious drawbacks of zoomuniversity consisting of depression, anxiety, and lack of social connection. An assembly where students negatively affected by zoomeverything as well as those endangered by inperson activies would greatly help the SSMU executives commit to policies that take into account the many factors of our latest university conundrum.

YES, the omnicron variant poses a danger to the health of many people, including the immunocompromised and the elderly. However, if SSMU actually held meetings to hear the opinions of the students affected, they would know that the vast majority of students would unequivocally benefit from a return to inperson courses with minimal health risks, but that students and professors who would be placed in harms way WOULD BENEFIT if the inperson courses were recorded in zoom during the inperson classes. Thus, SSMU would have concluded that the best course of action would have been to encourage the university to return to inperson courses but firmly demand that the university provide remote learning options for the students and professors that can not show up in person.

Unfortunately, SSMU could not have made such a policy decision because they chose to instead take to their own ideas completely blind to the realities faced by most of the students at the university today because SSMU failed to reach out to their constituents as any responsible government would have done.",1642439360,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/s68zea/why_is_ssmu_opposing_the_return_to_inperson/,109,WhosBread,s68zea,1/17/2022 17:09,"['seems', 'ssmu', 'put', 'statement', 'encouraging', 'mcgill', 'administration', 'take', 'specific', 'action', 'time', 'delaying', 'return', 'inperson', 'classes', 'without', 'actually', 'consulting', 'constituents.', 'yes', 'ssmu', 'elected', 'students', 'represent', 'student', 'body', 'serious', 'situations', 'return', 'inperson', 'classes', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'ssmu', 'executives', 'would', 'value', 'opinions', 'constituents.', 'ssmu', 'executives', 'held', 'meeting', 'assembly', 'sorts', 'allow', 'concerned', 'important', 'decisions', 'one', 'voice', 'opinions', 'could', 'draft', 'policy', 'made', 'benefit', 'everyone.', 'specifically', 'ssmus', 'decision', 'blatantly', 'oppose', 'return', 'inperson', 'activities', 'completely', 'ignorant', 'serious', 'drawbacks', 'zoomuniversity', 'consisting', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'lack', 'social', 'connection.', 'assembly', 'students', 'negatively', 'affected', 'zoomeverything', 'well', 'endangered', 'inperson', 'activies', 'would', 'greatly', 'help', 'ssmu', 'executives', 'commit', 'policies', 'take', 'account', 'many', 'factors', 'latest', 'university', 'conundrum.', 'yes', 'omnicron', 'variant', 'poses', 'danger', 'health', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'immunocompromised', 'elderly.', 'however', 'ssmu', 'actually', 'held', 'meetings', 'hear', 'opinions', 'students', 'affected', 'would', 'know', 'vast', 'majority', 'students', 'would', 'unequivocally', 'benefit', 'return', 'inperson', 'courses', 'minimal', 'health', 'risks', 'students', 'professors', 'would', 'placed', 'harms', 'way', 'would', 'benefit', 'inperson', 'courses', 'recorded', 'zoom', 'inperson', 'classes.', 'thus', 'ssmu', 'would', 'concluded', 'best', 'course', 'action', 'would', 'encourage', 'university', 'return', 'inperson', 'courses', 'firmly', 'demand', 'university', 'provide', 'remote', 'learning', 'options', 'students', 'professors', 'show', 'person.', 'unfortunately', 'ssmu', 'could', 'made', 'policy', 'decision', 'chose', 'instead', 'take', 'ideas', 'completely', 'blind', 'realities', 'faced', 'students', 'university', 'today', 'ssmu', 'failed', 'reach', 'constituents', 'responsible', 'government', 'would', 'done.']",1,0,0,0

was met only with six pairs of eyes blinking back at me and no one answering or saying anything for another solid awkward minute until the prof called everyone back to the main room, to which they all left immediately and to which i sat there alone looking only at my own clownish self in low resolution.

I graduated McGill with a 2.34 GPA! AMA,"Hi fellow McGillians,

During my ten semesters at McGill, I struggled A LOT  mental health issues, interpersonal issues, imposter syndrome... you name it. As you can see in the graph herehttpsimgur.comHRMb50c made for your amusement, I finished my first semester at McGill with a 0.58 term GPA. I went through the readmission process twice, failedincompleted more than 10 courses, and spent many semesters on academic probation. After five years, I barely graduated by the skin of my teeth.

I wanted to make this post to remind fellow struggling students that there is more to life than a perfect GPA. No, I likely wont be able to go to grad school in the near future, but I managed to land an interesting job in my field of study that pays well and offers a relatively good worklife balance. Not everyone at McGill is going to go to the ivies for grad school, and that is okay.

I never told a single person just how badly I was fucking up, and felt so aloneguilty throughout my  whole tenure at McGill. Im making this post to enable an open dialogue for students that dont feel theyre succeeding at McGill. Im proof that there is more to life than your undergrad GPA. Feel free to ask me anything  tips on how to pick yourself up, best study spots, how to get a job with a shitty GPA  Im an open book or PM me!.

"If I could make it, then you can do it too","So yesterday I submitted my master thesis, and it is kinda of a big deal for me. The truth is that the last years were insanely challenging. I had several days where my supervisor suggested that I withdraw since my mental health was very paralyzing. I started struggling with my mental health few months after starting my first semester at McGill. I actually never had time to take a breath, as bad things were coming one after the other, and I thought I could never make it to be honest. 

I failed so many assignments, cried myself to bed most of the time, I took a leave of absence and I lost count of the number of medical notes I required. I had days where I was insomniac for three days in row and even sleep pills couldnt help with it. I struggled with my sexuality and lost most my friends when it was time to come out, I experienced grief, assault, the death of my closest family members without being able to go home and see them, major depression, abandoment, loneliness, and I litteraly had no motivation to keep working on my studies. 

If I could make it, I want you to know that you could do it too, no matter how shitty or bad things are now. Try to ask for help, it is a sign of strength, talk to people, a lot of them at McGill are willing to help, or can show you resources to make things easier for you. Be extra compassionate with yourself, as we are litteraly in a middle of a pandemic, celebrate small achievements such as getting out of bed in the morning, dont compare yourself to others, life isnt a competition and only you knows whats going on in your life and heart, many of my friends graduated before me, and it made me feel isolated, but I realized that we are all different and we have different stories, that my productivity doesnt say anything about my worth as I was taught all my life.

QPIRG vote?,"What do people think about the QPIRG vote in the SSMU referendum?

I am an upperyear student who has been with McGill for a while. Funding QPIRG seems bad for McGill students and governance. Normally, when clubs want to charge fees, they charge fees to their members. In cases where the clubs provide a service that can benefit the McGill community as a whole, clubs would charge an optoutable fee. However, QPIRG, being a group centered on radical activism and activist research, should not be the recipient of such an automatic fee. The fee it charges is higher than that by McGill Tribune, even though McGill Tribunes activities are much more broadly felt than that of QPIRG. Worst of all, being an independent student service, QPIRG is almost completely insulated from SSMU oversight and the oversight of SSMU members.

Since QPIRG does not fall under SSMU jurisdiction, SSMU referendum cannot adjust its fees. Thats why we can only hold an existence referendum every five years. If we disapprove of QPIRGs fees, voting in this existence referendum is our only option.

Harassed on the metro,"So I wanted to come here and share an incident that happened to me this Sunday in the hopes that something similar doesnt happen to anyone on here.
So on Sunday around 100 pm I got up on the metro green line to be exact and it was on the emptier end as it usually is on weekends. There were multiple empty seats where I entered but there were around 78 people seated too. So I get on and sit on an empty two seater. I was on my way to a family gathering, listening to loud music and scrolling through my newsfeed, minding my own business. Suddenly, I see a guy who was on the other side of the metro come sit beside me even though there were multiple empty seats there. Instantly I become super alert and start internally panicking. I have bright blue headphones so it was pretty obvious that I could not hear anything he might have been saying to me. After a couple of seconds I see him put this number tab on his phone up and point it at me and hear him say the words can I have your number through the music. By then I was calling a friend so I could walk away while talking to him. So I call my friend and get up to go to another side and while I do that, he inappropriately touches me from behind. I manage to walk away and could feel myself shaking as I do and tried to hold back my tears in front of him. My friend stays on the phone with me until the guys gets off and the entire time he was there all I could do was shake and pray he does not follow me. I got off at my stop ane cried for 15 mins straight unable to process what had just happened.
All of this happened during the day, at a public place. I have heard of many horror stories from girls facing similar things but I did not think I would have to be so paranoid about my surroundings in broad daylight too. Now eveytime I am out I can feel myself being super self conscious and cant get myself to sit down on the metro with an empty seat beside me.

Guy on Sherbrooke asking for Money,"Not sure where else to talk about this, but basically, yesterday morning I was walking down Sherbrooke between Guy and Peel. For context, Im here in Montral for school. Anyways, Im walking and suddenly this guy runs up beside me and is flustered and seems to just be distressed and asks me if I speak English  which, yes, I do. Anyways, he proceeds to ask me if I have 3 change to spare. He seems distressed, and idk 3 isnt much and he is pretty well groomed so im thinking maybe its just money for the bus or something and hes in a rush, so Im like sure yeah one second. But then, just in a quick manner he goes on and is like, oh do you have a 20, I can give you change and idk why i just didnt give him the 3 but I pull out a 20 and hes just fingering through his wallet  which in hindsight I see was just a distraction I guess. Anyways, I give it to him and then he goes you know what, why dont you go ahead and give me another 20 and idk what but that just seemed a bit threatening  idk I really didnt want to get into any kind of altercation, I was just on my way to school. So long story short, 3 turned to 40, and he left saying dont worry ill pass it on. 

Now, I know, its all literally my fault, he didnt necessarily threaten me, and I could have just said no, but idk I just didnt and i dont know why. I know I sometimes have trouble saying no, but I guess this situation just hurt me. Me and my generosity were taken advantage of and idk maybe thats my own fault but it was still frustrating. And its not like unfortunately im rich, just living off work savings and student loans, so 40 is a lot. But idk, just feels like I was robbed but the thing is, I wasnt, I willingly gave him my money.

So, just a heads up for anyone, dont be stupid like me, and if anyone has any thoughtsadvice on if theres something I should doprecautions I should take, Id love to hear.

Its so awkward being poor,"I was in my language class today only 3 students and the topic of family and employment came up. It was horrible. I had to followup the kid whose parents were in policy and pharmaceuticals and explain that my mom has been unemployed for 20years on disability cuz of a car accident, my dad and grandpa are dead so I dont really know what they did for work, and my livingworking relatives are almost all sanitation workershousekeepingetc. 

Now let me emphasize that Im not even remotely embarrassed about what my family does for a living. I am actually extremely, extremely proud of them. My grandma has worked as a cleaner for 45 years and she just turned 70 but still wont retire. My grandma and her 11 siblings slowly as in onebyone immigrated to Canada in their teens with little to no English language skills and no education, yet they managed to build and design two homes by themselves with while each working 3 different full time cleaningfactory jobs. My family struggled super hard to scrimp and save every penny to build those houses that are worth millions today. I would love to be able to talk about them all day... in English, because explaining this shit in my second language was so damn difficult and humiliating. I dont automatically know the words for carpenter or architect. I have no idea how to say they grew their own food and they even built and designed a greenhouse. I cant explain the complex Canadian immigration system in my second language.

serious disturbing posts about Cloudberry tw animal cruelty,"Hi and hello fellow McGillians,

I have seen an alarming amount of posts conveying the death andor defamation of Cloudberry, our furry friend. People have joked about stomping on cloudbery, shown pictures of similar animals to them engaging in degrading acts, and much l more that I cannot bring myself to type. 

As someone who works with animals on a daily basis and has witnessed tw intense abused animals, this leaves me with a yucky feeling and quite frankly disgusted, and Im sure others feel the same. 

I think its for the best if we stop posts of Cloudberry on this sub to prevent the hypevitality around these posts and avoid these kinds of past trauma from arising in folks like me.

W Waived From Transcript? And getting more than 1 W?,"Has anyone ever had a W waived from their transcript? 

Im currently in my 4th year. I have 2 Ws on my transcript already one from first year, one from second year as well as 2 Fs from first year. Ive always taken 5 courses a semester. Im looking at withdrawing from a course since its really been stressing me out. Its a comp course Im in linguistics so Ive only done a bit of comp and we havent received any grades back COMP596LING483. I think the material is interesting but I can tell even if I did alright on the previous assignments which I cant know because no grades its going to take a lot of extra time to keep up with this course without even necessarily getting better than an alright grade...

I think I might have an actual case for getting my W waived if thats a thing that happens. After the start of the semester I was diagnosed with ADHD which obviously super affects my school performance. My psychologist did recommend a reduced course load but I kept going with the 5 because thats what Ive always done and I was hoping Id be able to get set up with meds and such for a good semester. Also I think I might have had everything finalized after the add drop deadline anyway. Now that Im partway through the semester, putting all these solutions in hasnt helped me quite as much as Id hoped along with taking up SO MUCH TIME. Im definitely going to start taking 4 course semesters after this one. So thats my case.

So my question is twofold. Has anyone ever had this sort of thing waived?

A plea for quiet in the ground floor hallway of the Mcconnell Engineering Building,"You know how on the ground floor of the Mcconnell Engineering Building there is a hallway with lots of natural light and desk space for people to study? Its one of the nicest places to study outside of the McGill libraries, and lots of students go there to do their work and attend their Zoom lectures.

Despite the fact that 95 of the students who use this space come here to work, there always seems to be a handful of students who treat this place like a conversation hall. These people are so loud that its very difficult to concentrate. Please, for the love of God, stop having loud conversations in the middle of a work space. McGill didnt put up long lines of chairs and desks in this hallway for a handful of loudmouths to have a conversation. Its a place for students to do their work. People can have loud conversations pretty much anywhere else, but please dont do it in the ground floor hallway of the Mcconnell Engineering Building.

Anybody else frustrated by these loud talkers?  


EDIT To be clear, I think its totally fair to be having a conversation if youre doing a group project and not being too loud. Its also perfectly reasonable if there is a fair nearby and people are selling food and advertising for clubs. What gets my goat is how people have really loud conversations in this space that have nothing to do with school work and with no regard for all of the students who are trying to get work done.

covid false positive,"im kind of desperate and i dont know who to turn to for advice, but maybe someone on here has been in a similar situation before. Anything helps. tldr at the bottom

i got covid in august, while i was still back home international student.

i live in montreal now. last week, i developed cold symptoms and went to get a covid test done as everyone should do if they develop cold symptoms!, paranoid that i had it again. the nurse at the covid clinic told me that i couldnt have it again, and that if the test came back positive it would be because of my previous covid experience, not because i have active covid, so i would not be required to selfisolate. the test they gave me was molecular, not an antigen test, so it obviously came back positive, even though i dont have active covid molecular tests will appear positive for months after youve had covid. 

i got a call this weekend from the province telling me to selfisolate and asking for information on everyone ive had contact with, so they isolate as well. i told them what the nurse said to me at the clinic and they essentially said my only instructions are to tell you to selfisolate. i have no idea what to do or who to contact to get out of this situation!! the nurse told me i would get a call from Health Canada and that is who I had to explain my situation to, but so far none of the calls I have recieved have been able to help! It doesnt help that since I got COVID abroad, my previous positive COVID test isnt on record here.

I have so much shit to do this week, I dont want to be quarantined considering i DONT have covid, and I especially dont want my roomates to have to quarantine and fuck up their weeks considering they havent even been exposed to anything. My cold symptoms werent even close to COVID, I had a mucusy cough not a dry cough, my mucus was yellow pointing to a viral infection, not COVID, etc, etc. I feel like Im being punished for doing what felt like the right thing 

Has anyone been in this position before? Any words of advice, or knowledge on who I should contact? Anything helps.

Hot Take The widespread anxiety about Covid among vaccinated students is unnecessary,"Recently, a lot of vaccinated students at McGill have been talking about how they are very worried about catching Covid and feel unsafe at the McGill campus. In the past few days on rmcgill there have been several posts from vaccinated students worried about catching Covid. Some users have even suggested that we should restrict class sizes further or make classes fully online again due to the rising number of cases and the gravity of the Covid health risk.

I think that this widespread anxiety about catching Covid for those who are double vaccinated and have no major immunodeficiencies is unjustified, and that we should take care to keep the risks in perspective. For those who do not suffer major immunodeficiencies and are vaccinated, the risk of having a serious case of Covid is so low that there is no reason whatsoever to lose sleep over the prospect of catching Covid or to feel afraid on McGill campus. Even if the number of cases in Quebec expands enormously over the course of the semester, the risk of suffering a serious case of Covid, much less a lifethreatening one, would still be dizzyingly low. For the vaccinated, we have more reason to fear stepping into a car than suffering a lifethreatening case of Covid.

And no, I am not one of those Covid denialists who posts conspiracy theories on Facebook downplaying the seriousness of Covid. Heres an excellent article from the New York Times about why the vaccinated should not be losing sleep over the possibility of getting Covid httpswww.nytimes.comarticlebreakthroughinfectionscovid19coronavirus.htmlhttpswww.nytimes.comarticlebreakthroughinfectionscovid19coronavirus.html. Here is a key passage from the article

Experts say anxiety about breakthrough infections remains pervasive, fueled in part by frightening headlines and unrealistic expectations about the role of vaccines.  
  
Theres been a lot of miscommunication about what the risks really are to vaccinated people, and how vaccinated people should be thinking about their lives, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. There are people who think we are back to square one, but we are in a much, much better place.

So no, if you are vaccinated and have no major immunodeficiencies there is no reason to lose any sleep about the prospect of catching Covid. We have no reason to be afraid of going to campus, even if we hear students coughing in our classes. And for those vaccinated students who are afraid that they might lose their life to Covid, I would highly recommend taking a look at the Covid statistics for Quebec. Even when we include all of the Covid deaths before vaccination, only 2.7 of all Covid deaths were for people between the ages of 0 and 59. If we zone in on the 2029 age range which almost all students belong to, only 0.1 of the Covid deaths came from people belonging to this age group. httpswww.quebec.caenhealthhealthissuesaz2019coronavirussituationcoronavirusinquebecc63035httpswww.quebec.caenhealthhealthissuesaz2019coronavirussituationcoronavirusinquebecc63035. Once you factor in the fact that vaccinated people have a much, much, much lower risk of dying of Covid... well, lets just say that vaccinated students shouldnt be afraid of dying of Covid.

It is crucial that we keep the risks in perspective. If McGill University decides to shut down inperson classes this semester, it will almost certainly be in response to the fears of its students rather than the actual risk of Covid. If we want to avoid the possibility of another campus shutdown, with all of the negative consequences on the quality of learning and mental health that this entails, we must not get unnecessarily anxious about the risk that Covid poses to our health. If vaccinated students with no immunodeficiencies still feel anxious about Covid and are afraid to be on campus, we should be clear that this is a problem of anxiety that should be tackled with therapy, medications, or simply talking it out with friends, rather than the reflection of serious health risks.

Weve got this, yall.

How is Mcgill with Postmodernism?,"Is it a school that encourages or opposes the ideology to run unchallenged?

Edit never mind, clearly I got my answer, in passive aggressive undertones too. thanks to everyone who took a serious consideration into my post, to everyone else 

 Rational argument can be conducted with some prospect of success only so long as the emotionality of a given situation does not exceed a certain critical degree. If the affective temperature rises above this level, the possibility of reasons having any effect ceases and its place is taken by slogans and chimerical wishfantasies. That is to say, a sort of collective possession results which rapidly develops into a psychic epidemic. In this state all those elements whose existence is merely tolerated as asocial under the rule of reason come to the top.

The vaccine only reduces your chances of catching it and it makes you less sick, but going to a club is sooo much worse than sitting in a classroom or doing extracurricular activities or sports

It starts getting late and I start getting upset as he didnt help me with my initial inquiry and Ive been sitting there for 4 hours hearing him talk about sticking his dick into places and get ready to leave but he tells me not to, and that I should spend the night cause its getting late. I get up and get ready to walk out but he begs me not to and tells me hell help me right now. I accept cause I need the help and we get into his car so we can move the piece of furniture I needed moved. Hes talking about sex again and rubs him arms on mine as hes speaking. I move away and he still manages to put his arm on my thigh,saying theres a bug on it. We move the furniture and he drops me off at the building again,asking me if he can come up to my apartment. I firmly say no. The next day, as I was walking down the staircase, he smacks my ass and corners me, specifying jokingly that I cant get past him unless I kiss him. Ive been crying about this non stop and feel trapped to be honest. During the lunch, he also shared that so many girls in the building wrongfully reported him for sexual harassment and he made their lives a living hell. He got out of the situation all those times and the girls either got evicted, got sued or experienced worse living conditions. These stories only happened in the last 48 hours and are only a few of many.
Im honestly way too scared to even report him as it could leave me worse off than if I just dealt with his shit. My mom recommended id get a guy friend that I could make coffee or food for and have him just visit pretty often so he knows Im not alone. I kind of dont want to get into all the legal stuff as I dont have the energy,money and time for it.

A Request to Profs with inperson lectures,"Dear Professors,

Some of us have really missed being in lecture halls, being in an environment where knowledge is imparted, and creative thoughts are had through conversations or in solitude.

A Guide to Study Spots from someone who has been here too long,"Here are some spots on campus, sorted based on key characteristics. Normally Id be a bit more secretive about these but I feel bad for the 2 cohorts of students who havent studied on campus yet. Apologies in advance to anyone whose secret spot I just spilled. Also note that some of these may have changed due to COVID Im basing these entirely on preCOVID experience.

Convenient

 McLennenRedpath Library the main library and the biggest. Basically the most typical library you can imagine. Has the most seats so youre most likely to find a seat here. There are different zones depending on how quiet you want it upper floors tend to be more quiet, standing desks, phone charging stations, a laptop rental machine, and a cafe in the basement. Theres a cyberthequehttpsgoo.glmapsoRqHyXcrNpyTiceQ9 for computer use with abundant power outlets. See those glass pods? They arent as soundproof as the people inside think they are.

 McConnellMacDonald Hallway its centrally located and you might pass by it on your way to class. Its loud, but some people like that. There are 247 computer labs for students in engineering around here. Theres a cafe nearby too and you can eat here.

 SSMU building has a whole bunch of stuff  a cafeteria with microwaves, a lounge with couches, Gerts. It has been closed for renovations for a long time, but apparently its open now ?!?. I have no idea what it looks like now, but it used to be a pretty popular spot for light studying.

247 

 Your 247 building depends on faculty most undergrads get 247 access to at least one building. For engineering it should be the McConnell complex. For arts its Ferrier, for science its Burnside, for management its Bronfman. If youre taking a CS class I think you get access to Trottier. Most of these buildings have an included computer lab too. I included a couple of these in the list. Note that the 247 access thing might have changed with COVID.

Cozy 

 Islamic Studies Library one of the coziest places on campus. Just lookhttpswww.mcgill.calibraryfileslibrarychannelsimageoctagonnew2010.jpg at it. Theres a couch underneath one of the staircases with a little desk lamp and is by far the most cozy spot I know on campus. Quiet area. Respect the reserved desks though  dont steal them from the grad students or at least be ready to move if they show up. 

 Law Library a bit far but it has a very cozy and modern vibe. Actually, each of the floors has a different vibe. A lot of the desks have built in desk lamps. A couple of the floors have booths that are great for privacy or if you want to cut down on distractions. Mostly a quiet study space. I believe its law students only around exam season correction seems like its certain floors that are restricted around exam time

 Birks Reading Room its small, cozy, and absolutely silent to the point where you have to take off your shoes inside. Limited hours but a very different feeling from McLennenRedpath.

Brightmusical

 Music Library Ive only been in here once but its in a modern building with big windows. There are even record players with a library of records here it is a music library after all. A lot of people dont know it exists so it doesnt get too full.

Techy

 Trottier a pretty popular spot for people in CS courses who have 247 access. Located up the hill and not easy to get to, but has great computing facilities including computers running Linux and a variety of different seating. Theres a cafe here.

Dungeon

 Burnside Basement its a brutalist dungeon. But if you spend enough time here then it becomes your brutalist dungeon and somehow you grow to love it. Or maybe its just Stockholm syndrome. Can be loud at times but you can eat while studying here. Science students get 247 access and free printing at the computer labs here.

 Ferrier arts only the building with the weirdest layout on campus  its basically a maze. The building is almost purposefully designed to be boring. Dont come here for good vibes, but you wont be distracted. The only study space here is a computer lab and an lounge, both are only for arts students who have 247 access.

Others

A list of all the other places where I know there are study spaces, but have less to sayknow less about. These are less popular.

 Stewart Bio South block a smattering of desks underneath the staircase when you walk in via the Dr. Penfield entrance, run by MBSU. Its far and up the hill, so most people just use this spot in between classes around here.

 Leacock lots of first year classes held here, but there are no desks here apparently there are study rooms on the west side of the first floor, thanks uCatanOverlord!  Plenty of benches if thats your preferred seating. There used to be a popular arts lounge in the basement only for arts students, but it has been closed for renovations.

 McIntyre Med there is a cafe on the 5th floor with study space. Again, a spot for when you have classes here since its so far away.

 Otto Maass study spots in the basement. There are phone charging machines here. Not really the best spot unless you have classes here.

 Rutherford Physics theres a small computer lab on the northern side facing Trottier. Not a very popular spot.

 Strathcona Anatomy there are a few desks scattered around the halls of the building, but are not very comfortable. There is an anatomy reading room card access only for students taking anatomy classes which looks like Hogwarts.

 Wong building a few study spaces around the main floor, and I believe a few computers for engineering students I havent been in here in a while, so this may have changed

 Duff there is a small area just outside one of the staircases with a bunch of computers set up. Its not really the nicest place to study but works if you have classes there.

Im sure there are other spots out there that I missed, so please feel free to add more especially you graduating students, what do you have to lose?.

"Near McGill Ghetto Yesterday, Being Racially Targetted and Called Chink Twice by Two Different Women Within 10 Minutes...","This incident or to be more precise, these two incidents happened yesterday on August 16 in the afternoon 425pm  440 pm near McGill. Personally, this was the first time ever that I encountered this kind of stuff and its been over 12 hours but I still cant stop thinking about it...

I left my office and took the route Rue Milton  Rue Hutchison  Rue PrinceArthur.

As I walked past the bookstore on Milton at around 425 pm to 430 pm, a middleaged female white, chubby, wearing glasses, had short hair walked up to me and said to me intendedly f u c k i n g   c h i n k. My head went blank for a bit and I just mechanically walked on.

Then as I continued my way and reached the entrance of 350 PrinceArthur Ouest at around 430435 pm, another woman seemed to be wearing some sort of scarf around her head, wearing sunglasses, middleaged approached me from the back and said to me l o o k ,   a n o t h e r  f u c k i n g   c h i n k... Again my head went blank and I am still angry at myself for not being able to articulate a response towards these two women and just left cowardly feeling like it was me who had done something bad instead of them

I am racially Chinese, and I have never had to deal with this kind of incident ever before, not even when I was in the US a few years back, until yesterday. I talked with other Asian colleages and none of them has encountered this, and they thought this should have been quite unusual, especially in Montreal... They suggested that it could be because I am young and female, and was walking alone, looking like an easy target...

Also, these two incidents happened way too consecutively and almost at the same area, it was hard to believe that it was merely a coincidence of some sort but maybe it was ahaha... and Im probably just unlucky I was also sort of angry at myself for just cowardly going blank twice without retaliating

Dont you think we deserve to have a wellprepared adapted reinitiation for inperson learning,"I am anxious. It seems like people either dont care about their academics or they are too good and want the restart of the semester to be tough so that they can stand out. Either way.

I think that after 1.5 years of

1. Loosing the academically challenging and overwhelming setting of inperson exams replaced with 2.5 times longer time exams that allow full course material access and are not worth as much as finals were usually worth.  Not all the classes were easier BUT certainly all exams were either a the same as inperson but with one of the three above mentioned advantages or b they were made to be more comprehension based and brainchallenging. In either of those 2 basically you have to flip your studying attitude 180 degrees which is not always good when you wanna go back.
2. Changing the studying style and relying less on memorization.  Again I know some classes had restricted browser during exams but certainly most of them didnt.
3. Having few exposure to the hard skills as labsinperson orals that are sometimes quite challenging but essential for the program objectives.
4. Being able to obtain customized personalized course materials as profs and TAs and expanded TEAM member s all had the sense of responsibility towards answering basically any question I had with very few delay.

I will stop here because the rest are dept specific

I am fully righteous of demanding some sort of adapted reinitiation to the inperson classes. I have read how many other universities in Canada even have taken into consideration the right of students to have a slow but constructive reinitiation. Some of the above arguments are from these unis prograrms.

You have been holding my hand all the pandemic like a baby and now suddenly you dump me after 1.5 years of me getting really used to having your hand. I was obviously dealing with immense changes just like everyone else during the time you were holding my hand. You told me you will help me so I shouldnt worry about school but rather worry about my mental and physical health.

Now I am completley lost. I forgot how to organize that I have to get 36 powerpoints memorized before the final exam for 5 classes. I forgot how to go to school and not be able to pause the recording. I forgot how to organize my time to attend office hours and tutorials now I cant just send them an email as I know they will never answer just like the good old days. Most importantly, I forgot how to take care of my mental health before and throughout an inperson exam period. I forgot how to socialize.

My suggestions do as many other Canadian unis. have the first two weeks online. This will certainly help me pace myself I can see the nature of my 5 courses and imagine how I will 1 study for them 2 organize myself to be mentally healthy rather than shook when I go to class first day

If this is too much to ask maybe at least have policy that prohibits quizzesmarked assignments first 2 weeks so that people can just settle before suddenly dropping in the completely alienated exam room with no academic preparedness mentality.

Idk which student affair officer should be responsible but whoever it is... What did you do to make all this stress of going back to inperson more tolerable? Are you gonna leave me go through all this myself like its some hunger games after I have been struggling with basically every lifeaspect the past 1.5 years? Did you read any articles that explain how this will be very difficult for students to adapt to because there are some?

This post might be criticized but I actually have recordings of myself when I was an allA student before the pandemic crying to my future self about how overwhelmed and afraid I am due to the many exams and how hard balancing all the As together was. My past self would be crying blood if I add all tha stress adapting to in person classes and exams.

Management is the best faculty,"Re Management is the worst faculty

Once upon a time I exaggerated and crapped on Desautels. I am back to tell u why Desautels is the best circus u can join.

1. Your undergrad isnt just about how much theory you learn, its about how much you learn that is actually useful. Desautels is by far the best at teaching u transferable soft skills and a general understanding of how any business or organization works. If you want to get employed, choose management over math or science. In a real STEM classroom you really will learn more, but u will most likely never use any of what you learn. In a business class, u use more of the concepts you learn even if you dont learn as much theory. People underestimate the value of 4 years of presentation practice, fiscal appreciation  basic money sense, and people skills. These are what help you go from a mindless employee, to one that can actually bring value to your organization. And a general understanding of business functions HR, ISIT, Marketing, accounting, finance, sales, operations, etc will always provide you with a competitive advantage in any role. In any job, u will touch on most, if not all, of these areas and your knowledge of how these functions work make you stand out from the crowd. Education and experience is your competitive advantage on the job market. Learning about the kernel of a vector will never be as valuable as knowing how to present your latest project to your manager.

2. Easy classes are good for you. If not your mental health, then ur GPA. Easy classes will always be so much better for your wellbeing. There are plenty of hard classes in Desautels, but when compared to their outoffaculty equivalents IE. Comp Sci vs business analytics, Desautels classes are far easier from an academic perspective. The most important part is that with easier classes, you have time to actually explore clubs, career options, and have free time to do the things you enjoy. I dont know why you wouldnt want easier classes.  

3. Management is diverseer. We have like 40 of students being international, we have a SOMEWHAT diverse student body that makes it a bit more interesting  even if some kids are snobby. You will also always be able to make outoffaculty friends and u dont have to get swept up in the snoblifestyle of Desautels. In the end, meeting snobby kids is inevitable, but having the connections with these peers may one day benefit you. Which faculty do u think the middle manger that helps you get into ur dream company is gonna be from?

4. The curve still sucks, but with some elbow grease and a tiny bit of hard work, u can score above the curve if u try.

5. Desautels is old fashioned, but the old folks are the ones that are hiring. This sucks to admit, but we know that unless ur in the valley, old folks will be the ones that hire us. You might as well know how boomers operate and how to get the best of your interactions with them.

Desautels is a horrible choice if u want to go into an extremely technical role or you want to pursue a closetopure sciences career. If you are studying math, comp sci, stats, arts, etc you should really consider an mba or just come to BComm. You are gonna be more employable, work less hard for the same pay, and will be LESS of a victim of capitalism. If you cant be it, be it, until u can do something about it IT being capitalism. Again, Im exaggerating, but Desautels is a great option if u dont know what to do because it prepares u for all jobs in some way or another. A Bcomm isnt an academic degree, its a career development degree. The degree helps you succeed in a career, not in academics, and in the end, 99 of people dont end up on academia. 

Management is the best Faculty and you truly gain more value for your future by learning about business than you do by learning about mitosis.

Im happy to one day be a commerce grad because I know I will have prepared for 4 years for a career in my area of interest  Ill be graduating with a career and not just a degree.",1627348895,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/oscx3t/management_is_the_best_faculty/,8,justin670,oscx3t,7/27/2021 1:21,"['management', 'worst', 'faculty', 'upon', 'time', 'exaggerated', 'crapped', 'desautels.', 'back', 'tell', 'u', 'desautels', 'best', 'circus', 'u', 'join.', '.', 'undergrad', 'isnt', 'much', 'theory', 'learn', 'much', 'learn', 'actually', 'useful.', 'desautels', 'far', 'best', 'teaching', 'u', 'transferable', 'soft', 'skills', 'general', 'understanding', 'business', 'organization', 'works.', 'want', 'get', 'employed', 'choose', 'management', 'math', 'science.', 'real', 'stem', 'classroom', 'really', 'learn', 'u', 'likely', 'never', 'use', 'learn.', 'business', 'class', 'u', 'use', 'concepts', 'learn', 'even', 'dont', 'learn', 'much', 'theory.', 'people', 'underestimate', 'value', 'years', 'presentation', 'practice', 'fiscal', 'appreciation', 'basic', 'money', 'sense', 'people', 'skills.', 'help', 'go', 'mindless', 'employee', 'one', 'actually', 'bring', 'value', 'organization.', 'general', 'understanding', 'business', 'functions', 'hr', 'isit', 'marketing', 'accounting', 'finance', 'sales', 'operations', 'etc', 'always', 'provide', 'competitive', 'advantage', 'role.', 'job', 'u', 'touch', 'areas', 'knowledge', 'functions', 'work', 'make', 'stand', 'crowd.', 'education', 'experience', 'competitive', 'advantage', 'job', 'market.', 'learning', 'kernel', 'vector', 'never', 'valuable', 'knowing', 'present', 'latest', 'project', 'manager.', '.', 'easy', 'classes', 'good', 'you.', 'mental', 'health', 'ur', 'gpa.', 'easy', 'classes', 'always', 'much', 'better', 'wellbeing.', 'plenty', 'hard', 'classes', 'desautels', 'compared', 'outoffaculty', 'equivalents', 'ie.', 'comp', 'sci', 'vs', 'business', 'analytics', 'desautels', 'classes', 'far', 'easier', 'academic', 'perspective.', 'important', 'part', 'easier', 'classes', 'time', 'actually', 'explore', 'clubs', 'career', 'options', 'free', 'time', 'things', 'enjoy.', 'dont', 'know', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'easier', 'classes.', '.', 'management', 'diverseer.', 'like', 'students', 'international', 'somewhat', 'diverse', 'student', 'body', 'makes', 'bit', 'interesting', 'even', 'kids', 'snobby.', 'also', 'always', 'able', 'make', 'outoffaculty', 'friends', 'u', 'dont', 'get', 'swept', 'snoblifestyle', 'desautels.', 'end', 'meeting', 'snobby', 'kids', 'inevitable', 'connections', 'peers', 'may', 'one', 'day', 'benefit', 'you.', 'faculty', 'u', 'think', 'middle', 'manger', 'helps', 'get', 'ur', 'dream', 'company', 'gonna', 'from?', '.', 'curve', 'still', 'sucks', 'elbow', 'grease', 'tiny', 'bit', 'hard', 'work', 'u', 'score', 'curve', 'u', 'try.', '.', 'desautels', 'old', 'fashioned', 'old', 'folks', 'ones', 'hiring.', 'sucks', 'admit', 'know', 'unless', 'ur', 'valley', 'old', 'folks', 'ones', 'hire', 'us.', 'might', 'well', 'know', 'boomers', 'operate', 'get', 'best', 'interactions', 'them.', 'desautels', 'horrible', 'choice', 'u', 'want', 'go', 'extremely', 'technical', 'role', 'want', 'pursue', 'closetopure', 'sciences', 'career.', 'studying', 'math', 'comp', 'sci', 'stats', 'arts', 'etc', 'really', 'consider', 'mba', 'come', 'bcomm.', 'gonna', 'employable', 'work', 'less', 'hard', 'pay', 'less', 'victim', 'capitalism.', 'cant', 'u', 'something', 'capitalism.', 'im', 'exaggerating', 'desautels', 'great', 'option', 'u', 'dont', 'know', 'prepares', 'u', 'jobs', 'way', 'another.', 'bcomm', 'isnt', 'academic', 'degree', 'career', 'development', 'degree.', 'degree', 'helps', 'succeed', 'career', 'academics', 'end', 'people', 'dont', 'end', 'academia.', 'management', 'best', 'faculty', 'truly', 'gain', 'value', 'future', 'learning', 'business', 'learning', 'mitosis.', 'im', 'happy', 'commerce', 'free', 'time', 'flexibility', 'need', 'school.', 'im', 'happy', 'one', 'day', 'commerce', 'grad', 'know', 'prepared', 'years', 'career', 'area', 'interest', 'ill', 'graduating', 'career', 'degree.']",1,0,0,0

Replacing Econ 257 Economic Statistics,"In pre covid times I went to talk to the Honours Econ advisor about replacing Econ 257 with Math 356357.

Do any international students regret coming to McGill?,"This question is meant mostly for international students, other than those from the US.

I am an international student from Europe not France or the UK and I often look back on my decision to come to McGill. There are not many people from my home country at McGill, and my friendshipsnetworks formed in Canada do not transfer back to my home country. It makes me feel lonely and isolated in a specific social bubble of each country. I feel that I am just wasting my life at McGill, because I plan to come back home after graduation I understood that Canada is not for me, and I am essentially absent from social life in my home country from September to April. Careerwise, I also cannot participate in most of the parttime internship programs because they require me to be in the country during the year. And neither do I enjoy McGill that much I think that it is a hostile and competitive environment. And Montreal is...alright.

Simultaneously, I feel that I am gradually becoming more distant with my old friends from my country. I also dont belong to North American partying culture it seems immature and dumb. And socializing with CanadiansAmericans is weird. In general I grew to dislike Canada and Quebec a lot. I think that it is a country that has nothing to offer to the worldit is boring and dull. Of course what I am saying here is a bit of an oversimplification and exaggeration, but my statement nevertheless holds true. Additionally, toxic SJWlike campus politics is offputting because it literally ignores the existence of my distinct culture, language and identity it clumps me into the generic white American culture. I find it offensive. 

Why did I exclude American students from my question? This is because I view the US as culturally similar to Canada, and because there are many American students at McGill, so it is a different situation regarding maintaining friendships across the border. Many Americans also come to McGill for the cheap tuition and it is good value for money for them, which is opposite for me.

So I just wanted to ask other international students if they find themselves in this situation? How do you go about it?

How Bill 96 Could Impact Anglophones In Montreal,"Hi all,

I wanted to share this article in hopes of highlighting provincial legislation Bill 96 that I think could seriously harm the ability for Anglophone students in Montreal to access government services as well as having certain restricted rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the Canadian constitutionhttpsmontrealgazette.comopinioncolumnistshanesthedevilisinthedetailsofbill96andtheyarealarminghttpsmontrealgazette.comopinioncolumnistshanesthedevilisinthedetailsofbill96andtheyarealarming

Namely 

  Large numbers of allophones and other linguistic minorities could be stripped of the ability to communicate with the government in English. 

  Quebec civil servants could face disciplinary measures if they speak or communicate in English with citizens deemed ineligible.

  There are no guarantees ensuring emergency services like 911 or UrgencesSant ambulances would continue to be offered in English. 

  The elimination of knowledge of English as a criterion for selecting judges and no requirement for judges to speak English in Quebec court houses.

I am wondering if anyone knows any additional groupsorganizations that are looking to fight Bill 96, or if other students are in any way concerned about this and how it might impact them?",1623349263,201,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/nwukcn/how_bill_96_could_impact_anglophones_in_montreal/,150,Durkheim_42,nwukcn,6/10/2021 18:21,"['hi', 'wanted', 'share', 'article', 'hopes', 'highlighting', 'provincial', 'legislation', 'bill', 'think', 'could', 'seriously', 'harm', 'ability', 'anglophone', 'students', 'montreal', 'access', 'government', 'services', 'well', 'certain', 'restricted', 'rights', 'supposed', 'guaranteed', 'canadian', 'constitution', 'namely', 'large', 'numbers', 'allophones', 'linguistic', 'minorities', 'could', 'stripped', 'ability', 'communicate', 'government', 'english.', 'quebec', 'civil', 'servants', 'could', 'face', 'disciplinary', 'measures', 'speak', 'communicate', 'english', 'citizens', 'deemed', 'ineligible.', 'guarantees', 'ensuring', 'emergency', 'services', 'like', 'urgencessant', 'ambulances', 'would', 'continue', 'offered', 'english.', 'elimination', 'knowledge', 'english', 'criterion', 'selecting', 'judges', 'requirement', 'judges', 'speak', 'english', 'quebec', 'court', 'houses.', 'wondering', 'anyone', 'knows', 'additional', 'groupsorganizations', 'looking', 'fight', 'bill', 'students', 'way', 'concerned', 'might', 'impact', 'them?']",0,0,0,0

Girls and just anyone in general please be careful downtown at night,"It saddens me that I have to make a post like this but here we go. I was walking on st cath near the bay and an obviously intoxicated man started catcalling  me ayy mami you alright?? and stuff like that and I just wasnt in the mood and was trying to be witty so i was like i will be if you leave me alone and then he didnt like that much started calling me btch and whatnot. I did keep mocking him by repeating back everything he said to me and that was probably egging him on so maybe it was partly my fault but still....
 I then crossed the street and he kept going on the other side and then a few seconds later threw I think a firecracker from the other side into my direction. Im not sure what it was but i found the stub where it landed and it looks like a mini stick of dynamite about the size of ur finger. Luckily he was kind of dumb in throwing it because I saw it coming and booked it in the other direction and yelled before it exploded a couple of feet away from where I wouldve been.  Im sure a few people probably saw or heard. 

The guy was wearing a black cap and baggy mostly black clothing and was a black person. Thankfully he did not hurt me quite frankly Im just more pissed off that I wasted a bunch of time that I couldve spent finishing my lecture lol but I wanted to warn everyone here in case he turns up again, I dont want him to succeed on anyone. 

I have already reported to police and they said they cant really do anything without footage and unless I press charges which I think is going to do more harm to me than good. All they can really do is keep an eye out and watch him if he pops out

will update this as better summaries come out

 Quebec plans on reaching 75 of vaccinated adults by June 15, 9 days earlier than their goal of June 24.

 Most regions will pass to Orange by May 28, then Yellow by June 14. This means restaurants reopening and indoor very small gatherings being allowed. You can read the detailed set of measures for yellow and green here.httpswww.quebec.caenhealthhealthissuesaz2019coronavirusprogressiveregionalalertandinterventionsystem

 On June 28, most regions will become Green, which allows indoor gatherings up to 10 people.

 Schools are reopening this Monday, with some exceptions for sec 345 in red zones.

 Quebec plans on lifting mandatory masks midaugust if 75 of adults have their second dose by then.

 May 28 Curfew lifted, all terraces open, gathering up to 8 people in yards, movement between regions, up to 250 people by section in stadiums and rooms, max 2500.

 Cegeps and universities will be inperson in the Fall.

Montreal is currently red, not special alert, so it should be part of the regions that reach Green by the end of June.httpswww.quebec.caenhealthhealthissuesaz2019coronavirusprogressiveregionalalertandinterventionsystemmapofcovid19alertlevelsbyregion?gclidCjwKCAjwy42FBhB2EiwAJY0yQvEXt2fIkkgxOuRTNvmLu2c0sdERVGlCjdPbh6aJIj1wCzJU4CLbRoCuh0QAvDBwE",1621372546,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/nfmi1x/quebec_presents_reopening_plan_and_confirms/,42,Thermidorien,nfmi1x,5/18/2021 21:15,"['update', 'better', 'summaries', 'come', 'quebec', 'plans', 'reaching', 'vaccinated', 'adults', 'june', 'days', 'earlier', 'goal', 'june', '.', 'regions', 'pass', 'orange', 'may', 'yellow', 'june', '.', 'means', 'restaurants', 'reopening', 'indoor', 'small', 'gatherings', 'allowed.', 'read', 'detailed', 'set', 'measures', 'yellow', 'green', 'here.', 'june', 'regions', 'become', 'green', 'allows', 'indoor', 'gatherings', 'people.', 'schools', 'reopening', 'monday', 'exceptions', 'sec', 'red', 'zones.', 'quebec', 'plans', 'lifting', 'mandatory', 'masks', 'midaugust', 'adults', 'second', 'dose', 'then.', 'may', 'curfew', 'lifted', 'terraces', 'open', 'gathering', 'people', 'yards', 'movement', 'regions', 'people', 'section', 'stadiums', 'rooms', 'max', '.', 'cegeps', 'universities', 'inperson', 'fall.', 'montreal', 'currently', 'red', 'special', 'alert', 'part', 'regions', 'reach', 'green', 'end', 'june.']",1,0,0,0

Walk Safe  Harassment on Prince Arthur,"Hey allmy girlfriend had an uncomfortable encounter with someone in Milton Park on Saturday evening May 15th. She doesnt have a Reddit account, but she asked that I make a post to share what happened. 

While out on a walk by herself, she was approached by a young, seemingly studentaged guy on the corner of Hutchison and Prince Arthur. He began complimenting her, and despite the fact that she didnt stop walking and was clearly uncomfortable, started asking her questions about herself where was she going, where was she coming from, had she been alone, does she have a boyfriend, you have a boyfriend but is he around, etc. The guy followed her for two blocks or so to the AlymerPrince Arthur intersection before he said something along the lines of, okay, well Im going to respect you because you have a boyfriend, and headed off. 

I mean, theres so much to be said about this, but for starters, there is no good reason to approach a random woman or anyone, really on the street and to start asking her personal questions. This is not the way to make friends or to flirt. Second, is having a partner what qualifies someone for respectful treatment? It doesnt matter if she has a boyfriend or not, harassment is harassment. 

She ended up filing a police report, but in light of this and other similar posts in this subreddit the first I think of being the Stewart bio one a couple months ago, we need to ensure that we as a community are on the lookout for this kind of behavior. If youve had a similar experience, please dont hesitate to reach out.

Two girls were verbally assaulted on McTavish street and drove away  Help me FIND THEM to complete the police report,"I wish I had it on video.

Around 520pm May 15th, as the ProPalestine protests were dialing down

I was walking down McTavish coming from the Y intersection and I saw two girls average size, Arablooking, 1720 years old, the first girl had black hair, and black paint on her cheekbones driving up McTavish on a single moped color withdrawn for future verification. On my right were a group of big guys 6 foot plus, around 1819 years old, there was atleast 7 of them that immediately stood up and started yelling to the girls Fuck you, Fuck you and the girls were responding Fuck you, Fuck you and the guys yelled back Vive Israel in french and then you Muslim pieces of shit as the girls drove off north.

The guys were all whitepale skin with baggy white shirts, jeans and sneakers. Some of them had ear piercings. One guy was black with dreadlocks and a bright red hoodie. The guy in the red hoodie had the loudest voice and according to me and other witnesses was distinctly the one that yelled you Muslim pieces of shit. Of course, yelling about politics is somewhat predictable but calling them out over religion is not, especially on campus. You dont even know if theyre Muslim in the first place.

I wanted to confront the guys but there was 7 of them vs me. I talked to nearby police 1km away but they were STM so they couldnt do anything. I called McGill security and they came back and started the investigation. They found a couple of other witnesses that verified what I said. The assailants denied to give McGill security any ID. The red hoodie guy tried playing the black card. McGill couldnt detain them so I called 911 McGill sec. told me to and they said since the victims were gone, the police cant do anything until I find the girls.

Its unlikely that either the victims or the assailants go to McGill. The search needs to spread further!

I have the file number and all the witnessess phone numbers ready to go. Just need to find the victims to complete the report. Only the police can retrieve the CCTV footage on the street, McGill cannot.

If you are the victims and you are reading this thinking Im fine, I dont need this trouble THIS IS NOT FOR YOU ONLY. This is for everyone. This could have been anyone. This could have been me and Im not even Muslim but I look like I am.

If you happened to witness this, DM me. Your statement will be very helpful. By the time McGill security had arrived, only two witnesses were leftwilling to give a statement and they were sitting 130m away from the scene so clearly the WHOLE STREET had heard it. There was at least 20 other people there.

TLDR  Two girls going up McTavish on a moped were called muslim pieces of shit by a group of guys. I called police and McGill security but the victims need to identify themselves to complete the report and retrieve CCTV footage so that atleast the guys would be banned from campus. Help me find the victims!

"All Fall 2021 Exchange Canceled, but They Still Expect Us to Be on Campus Hypocrisy?","Email about the cancellation of Fall 2021 Exchange and Term Away

x200B

Dear McGill student,

I am writing today to provide an update regarding your plans to study abroad this upcoming Fall semester. Over the past few months, McGill has been closely monitoring Covid19 developments and international travel restrictions in the hopes that we may be able to resume our regular international activities this coming semester. Unfortunately, public health landscapes, vaccine rollout plans, health regulations continue to vary widely from country to country. Additionally, the Canadian government is currently maintaining a Global Level 3 travel advisory, indicating that all nonessential travel outside of Canada should be avoided until further notice. As such  and given that the deadlines to make arrangements for an exchange or independent study away are approaching quickly  McGill has made the very difficult decision to cancel all outbound exchanges and term away for the Fall 2021 semester. This decision was not taken lightly, and was reached through, above all else, concern for the safety and wellbeing of our students. Due to the significant planning and logistical requirements involved, it will not be subject to change based on public health developments in the coming months.

It is important that I also communicate that students will not be able to take online courses with the host university they were set to attend in Fall 2021. While this option was strongly considered, the many unknowns, logistical challenges, and recognition that virtual exchanges simply do not provide the kind of international experience and cultural enrichment that we want for our students, raised serious concern. This is especially true now that the vaccine rollout in Quebec will allow McGill to resume some form of inperson learning in the Fall, an experience which will inarguably prove richer than continued online learning. These considerations led us to the decision that exchanging virtually is not an adequate replacement for inperson exchange opportunities at this time.

Here are some other important points to note regarding the cancellation of Fall 2021 including full year exchanges

 The 150 application fee for the Fall 2021 exchange application will be refunded  and your application will be automatically cancelled. Please do not submit a cancellation form.
 Deferrals will not be possible for the Winter 2022 semester. Should you want to take part in an exchange for the Winter 2022 term, we recommend that you first consult with your faculty advisor to discuss your options and eligibility.
 Should you wish to go on exchange in Winter 2022, it will be necessary to reapply. The application dates for Winter 2022 are yet to be announced. Please check the McGill Abroad websitehttpswww.mcgill.camcgillabroad for updates in the upcoming weeks.
 Given the cancellation, please be aware that no faculty mobility awards will be granted for the Fall 2021 semester, and needbased mobility bursary for exchangehttpswww.mcgill.castudentaidspecialfundingmobilityexchanges applications will not be assessed by the Student Aid Office.

  The application fee refund will be processed once the Winter 2022 application review is completed and provided you do not apply for a Winter 2022 exchange.

I understand that this is extremely disappointing news. Study abroad experiences are incredibly important to students academic, personal, and professional development, and McGill intends to resume outbound exchanges and term away activities as soon as it is safe to do so. By cancelling the arrangements made for Fall 2021, we hope to ensure that your future experiences abroad are both rewarding and safe. If you have any questions, please contact mcgillabroadmcgill.camailtomcgillabroadmcgill.ca and CC your faculty. Please also include your student ID number so that the McGill Abroad team can best respond to and keep track of your inquiry. For the most updated coronavirusrelated information, please visit the McGill Coronavirus webpagehttpswww.mcgill.cacoronavirus.

Thank you for your understanding and resilience in light of these updates.

Prayers and thoughts to our friends who have familyfriends in Palestine ,"The clashes in Jerusalem are leaving many people injured and the evictions in sheikhaljarrah are leaving many people homeless and subject to deliberate political oppression. Not only physical violence and oppression but there is a form of soulwrecking devastation when people of Palestine are recognizing that Palestine as they know it is perishing and this form of pain literally feels like your soul is suffering if you ask any Palestinian. There is also a strong form of sympathy since we know that those people have been dealing with humanterritorial losses for a very long time its literally the longest standing conflict of the current world which means that it is really devastating.

Therefore, you can see how it is tough for Palestinians at McGill especially if they have friendsfamily who are locked up in Palestine since the feeling that home is going through difficult existential crisis is definitely a lot to handle.

"Just graduated, feeling emptier than ever","Im waiting for the last grades to be assigned and then I should get my Bachelors. This has been the most anticlimacticunderwhelming graduation I could have ever imagined.

I was very burnedout during the last semester. My attention span makes goldfish look like Buddha. I sought private counselling but I just spent 1000 with no improvement for my mental state whatsoever. 

Feels like I learned nothing. My parents paid a fortune for my tuition, and I got nothing to show for it except for some garbage degree that wont get me accepted to any workplace. I have to go for a Masters to which I almost didnt get accepted and Im already dreading the start of next fall.

Im very bored these days. I have a desire to do some activities which unfortunately have been prohibited for months.

Why no online option for FALL 2021?,"My comment on a different post got a lot of responses, so I decided to make a post about it.

Please dont dismiss this post just because you dont like online uni no one does and try to see the situation from the perspective of other students.

I dont understand why McGill is not giving an online option for FALL 2021.

Forcing students to come to Montreal from all around the world just so they might have an exam in person makes no sense to me.

For example, Im an international student and in my home country in Asia right now. The vaccination isnt going well and I dont think Ill be vaccinated by September. In the fall Ill be taking a couple of CS courses in the fall, since they are larger than 150 ppl the lectures are going to be held online, they are also mostly projectbased no exam what so ever, just maybe small quizzes on MyCourses, except maybe one course might exams, Now I dont see why Id have to come all the way to Montreal, rent a place, ... just so maybe I need to take that one exam. IT MAKES NO SENSE.

Im really happy that the world is slowly going back to normal and absolutely hate online universities. I understand all of your frustration will zoom uni and know that every person wants to get back to the old normal union life. But lets face it, Fall 2021 will still not be normal uni life. It seems to me that McGill is rushing to go back to entirely in person. They are causing a lot of problems for a lot of people, and they are obviously uncertain themselves. The fact that they need to have a bunch of scenarios and plans depending on what happens means that they dont know what theyre doing either.

x200B

Im just trying to say that if students want to get a bit closed to normal sure they can go to Montreal rent a place and do the most inperson activity they can. But I dont its fair of the university to force everyone to be on campus for fall 2021 and say that all students, faculty, and staff should be in Montreal given that we are still uncertain about what will happen.

This is especially a problem for the international student population, students with classes that are large, students with projectbased classes,...",1620521646,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/n82s76/why_no_online_option_for_fall_2021/,49,Antique_Astronaut347,n82s76,5/9/2021 0:54,"['comment', 'different', 'post', 'got', 'lot', 'responses', 'decided', 'make', 'post', 'it.', 'please', 'dont', 'dismiss', 'post', 'dont', 'like', 'online', 'uni', 'one', 'try', 'see', 'situation', 'perspective', 'students.', 'dont', 'understand', 'mcgill', 'giving', 'online', 'option', 'fall', '.', 'forcing', 'students', 'come', 'montreal', 'around', 'world', 'might', 'exam', 'person', 'makes', 'sense', 'me.', 'example', 'im', 'international', 'student', 'home', 'country', 'asia', 'right', 'now.', 'vaccination', 'isnt', 'going', 'well', 'dont', 'think', 'ill', 'vaccinated', 'september.', 'fall', 'ill', 'taking', 'couple', 'cs', 'courses', 'fall', 'since', 'larger', 'ppl', 'lectures', 'going', 'held', 'online', 'also', 'mostly', 'projectbased', 'exam', 'ever', 'maybe', 'small', 'quizzes', 'mycourses', 'except', 'maybe', 'one', 'course', 'might', 'exams', 'dont', 'see', 'id', 'come', 'way', 'montreal', 'rent', 'place', '...', 'maybe', 'need', 'take', 'one', 'exam.', 'makes', 'sense.', 'im', 'really', 'happy', 'world', 'slowly', 'going', 'back', 'normal', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'online', 'universities.', 'understand', 'frustration', 'zoom', 'uni', 'know', 'every', 'person', 'wants', 'get', 'back', 'old', 'normal', 'union', 'life.', 'lets', 'face', 'fall', 'still', 'normal', 'uni', 'life.', 'seems', 'mcgill', 'rushing', 'go', 'back', 'entirely', 'person.', 'causing', 'lot', 'problems', 'lot', 'people', 'obviously', 'uncertain', 'themselves.', 'fact', 'need', 'bunch', 'scenarios', 'plans', 'depending', 'happens', 'means', 'dont', 'know', 'theyre', 'either.', 'xb', 'im', 'trying', 'say', 'students', 'want', 'get', 'bit', 'closed', 'normal', 'sure', 'go', 'montreal', 'rent', 'place', 'inperson', 'activity', 'can.', 'dont', 'fair', 'university', 'force', 'everyone', 'campus', 'fall', 'say', 'students', 'faculty', 'staff', 'montreal', 'given', 'still', 'uncertain', 'happen.', 'especially', 'problem', 'international', 'student', 'population', 'students', 'classes', 'large', 'students', 'projectbased', 'classes...']",1,1,0,0

Choosing between universities ...,"Hello! 

Essentially, my choice has come down to between UofT St.George and McGill. While I know none of you can speak as much for UofT if you can please go ahead, I wanted to get some insight into McGill. 

I am going into undergrad and I plan to do an honours in philosophy with a minor in French literature. Id like to pursue law afterwards which would entail law school. My questions to you is as follows 

1. How difficult is it to maintain a high GPA in the humanities at McGill? Think around 3.8
2. I have heard a lot about curving down grades, but I have heard that coming mostly from STEM students. Is it as prominent in the humanitiessocial science?
3. While I know that for the most part the quality of education is the same at McGill and UofT in this context, which school would be more recognisable or whose name would carry more merit when it comes to international law school admissions? Stanford, NYU, Oxford, Harvard, Yale, Columbia, etc....
4. Is there any statistics anywhere on where the Canadian students from these law schools have gotten their undergraduate degrees? Or does anyone know of people from McGill who have gone on to pursue law in one of these more prestigious schools?

Thank you for your help! I am just trying to get an idea of how suited each school is for individuals looking to pursue law in this manner... any help is appreciated ",1619419474,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/myrhw1/choosing_between_universities/,6,philosophyb,myrhw1,4/26/2021 6:44,"['hello!', 'essentially', 'choice', 'come', 'uoft', 'st.george', 'mcgill.', 'know', 'none', 'speak', 'much', 'uoft', 'please', 'go', 'ahead', 'wanted', 'get', 'insight', 'mcgill.', 'going', 'undergrad', 'plan', 'honours', 'philosophy', 'minor', 'french', 'literature.', 'id', 'like', 'pursue', 'law', 'afterwards', 'would', 'entail', 'law', 'school.', 'questions', 'follows', '.', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'high', 'gpa', 'humanities', 'mcgill?', 'think', 'around', '.', '.', 'heard', 'lot', 'curving', 'grades', 'heard', 'coming', 'mostly', 'stem', 'students.', 'prominent', 'humanitiessocial', 'science?', '.', 'know', 'part', 'quality', 'education', 'mcgill', 'uoft', 'context', 'school', 'would', 'recognisable', 'whose', 'name', 'would', 'carry', 'merit', 'comes', 'international', 'law', 'school', 'admissions?', 'stanford', 'nyu', 'oxford', 'harvard', 'yale', 'columbia', 'etc....', '.', 'statistics', 'anywhere', 'canadian', 'students', 'law', 'schools', 'gotten', 'undergraduate', 'degrees?', 'anyone', 'know', 'people', 'mcgill', 'gone', 'pursue', 'law', 'one', 'prestigious', 'schools?', 'thank', 'help!', 'trying', 'get', 'idea', 'suited', 'school', 'individuals', 'looking', 'pursue', 'law', 'manner...', 'help', 'appreciated']",1,0,0,0
Dont cheat. McGill can hunt you down 100,"so i got an email from DO for the NA grade i received last semester. I thought McGill wouldnt be able to hunt me down but they did. 

Article 17a of the code According to IP address data obtained from Chegg.com and myCourses, you performed online searching andor uploading of material related to the exam questions, in violation of the exam instructions.

SO DONT CHEAT !
they will hunt you down !

 and cheating is already bad ! even if youre tempted, be truthful to yourself and dont seek for any help 

 long story short, i googled some exam questions while taking an exam, and found same questions with answers posted on chegg posted 1 year ago so it seems like prof reused questions so i was tempted and looked for more questions. they traced my ip address with my time stamp on mycourses and crosscompared and tracked me

McGill Fall 2021 UPDATE for inperson activities TownHall Update 2  April,"Heres a summary of the announcements from todays TownHall update 

x200B

 Main points
    All students, and teaching staff are expected to be available on campus
       This is important and was emphasised multiple times even if all your lectures are big classes with online lectures, you are expected to be available on campus as some components labstutorials will be inperson and some exams could be as well
    Some exams will be inperson even if the lectures are online
    No bookings will be necessary for Study Hubs  Flex Spaces

    Residences will be open, with 1st year guarantee
    Planning is done carefully with the Minister of Health and Education  Health professionals
    The measures announced are still in the planning phase nothing is certain, nothing is set in stone

x200B

 Most likely scenario slide 4, considering a major proportion of the population will be vaccinated
    Academic program delivery
       Most lectures with 150 will be inperson. If a class is assigned a room on the course schedule, this means it will most likely be indeed in person but the room assignment might change
       Larger classes with online lectures will most likely still have some inperson components like labs, tutorials, office hours
       All labs scheduled
       Midtermfinal exams remote andor inperson as per instructor or capacity not in the field house but in smaller bookable spaces on campus
       The class schedule already available on VSBMinerva isnt expected to change but the room assignment yes to get the capacity filling right
    Faculty and staff
       Progressive return, starting with 30 on campus presence
    Study Hubs  Flex spaces
       Study Hubs in Redpath, Law, McLennan 2 floors and Mac wont require seat booking.
       Supervised major flex spaces within Faculties, 4 sectors downtown and 1 on Mac
    Services for students
       Inperson and remote, favouring prescheduled appointments
       Limited athletics activities
    Residences and Food Services
       Residences open with larger student bubbles same address could be considered as one floor rather than one room
       Residence and most nonresidence food services mostly open
    EventsExtracurricular activities
       Events will be explored on an exceptional basis
       Larger events like Frosh and Orientation are still in reflection but is not the main focus for the moment academic activities are

x200B

 Planning of Fall is estimated to be at 59 progress, with a plan to being done midMay. Operationalisation will start thereafter slide 2.

x200B

 Vaccination in talk with the Public Health authorities
    International students already in Quebec will have the same eligibility as nationals
    International students arriving in Quebec will be able to get their vaccine once they finish their quarantine in September, further details to come
    Mcgill doesnt intend to require a proof off vaccination to be on campus  require vaccination
    McGill wont have their own vaccination center for the McGill only community like other companies could
    It is likely that there will still be some kind of quarantine in August  September though there is no definite answer to this yet. Every student will be allowed to come back in.

x200B

 Visa delays
    McGill is in discussion with the authorities and is confident that if you put in your request ASAP, you will get it in time
    Most visa requests will be processed faster than the announced timesdelays

Homelessness on Parc and Milton,"Hi, I have been living in the Milton Parc area for the last 4 years and have never had an issues with the homeless residents of the area until yesterday. 

I was crossing the Parc Avenue and Milton intersection with my dog. Half way through the intersection, a homeless man, who was clearly intoxicated, purposely kicked my dog in the ribs. He proceeded to tell me to fuck off. I called  the police and was told there was nothing they can do. 

It seems like that intersection has become somewhat dangerous over the last few months. 

Does anyone know if the city of Montreal is actively working to solve this issue?

Do you think God torments his creations for pleasure? Simply because they are there and he can?,"I do. I think he gets off on it.

Just bombed a presentation. There were some tech issues and I have a hard time public speaking anyway, and it was just the perfect storm. I feel like my profs opinion of me hit rock bottom and just kept going. My heart is pounding in my little chest and I want to take a misery nap but I am too miserable to fall asleep 

I thought I was going to do so well on this assignment and redeem myself for a whole semester of lackluster participation and learning. It appears I set my sights too high, again. Will I be happy if this man gives me a passing grade in the class? At this point Id be ecstatic if he spat in my face and never spoke to me again.

What will I do? I had plans to be a successful business person but this year is proving that that path Aint For Me, and my grades are too poor for grad school. I could still marry rich, but I am at the hottest Ill ever be right now and I cant meet guys rn because Covid is a thing and Im a responsible bitch. AAAAAAh

idk, I just thought that this year would turn out differently. Im drowning in my schoolwork and my gpa is terrible and my mental health has taken both an upswing and a nosedive. I dont know how Im going to find a job when I graduate, or if Ill ever live a life where Im making my parents proud or at least living above the poverty level. Its scary and sad and I dont want to think about it too hard or Ill start crying

2021 MONTREAL HOUSING MEGATHREAD,"Hello everyone,

This is a userrequested megathread for all questions related to residences housing in Montreal as McGill transitions to inperson activities for the Fall.

We will have this megathread pinned until we have something else we need to pin, and if its very popular well keep it pinned longer. We might also close it during finals and then open a new one for the summer with answered QAs based on the comments in this one, and eventual announcements from McGill.

Anyway, have fun and best of luck to everyone with their return to Montreal or continued existence within the city for people who havent left!

EDIT to clarify, this is for QUESTIONS about housingmontreal, not for actual apartment postings and requests. It can be extremely unsafe to work with anonymous apartment postings and we encourage you to use website in which some form of identity verification is possible.

Weird experience with the semi return to inperson lectures? Anyone else?,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share this odd experience I had at a live lecture. I really think the pandemic and online learning has not only gotten to the students but our profsadmin as well. 

So I walk into my room for my radical political thought poli sci lecture and my prof is already acting a bit strange. On the desk of each student is a pair of those weird oversized glasses that people wear at parties and for the funny photo shoots. People just kinda said nothing and no one was wearing them. But when everyone came and sat down the prof started yelling at people to wear them because we are all really radical dudes and that todays lecture was going to be lit fam then proceeded to try and fail at whistling some song that he claim he heard on tictac.

After the whistling and dabbing was over, the prof hunched over his computer furiously typing something in while mumbling to himself what strange times were in! then laughing to himself. When people still didnt put on the big glasses the prof yelled dont worry guys i sanitized them!!! but I didnt see any hand sanitizer on his desk or around him so I have no clue how he could have done it. 

The projector then turned on and it was just a youtube video of top ten family guy funny moments Stewie edition. He pressed play without making the video fullscreen and we all just kinda sat there and watched. The prof just wouldnt stop laughing way to hard at all the kinda mediocre jokes and kept trying to imitate Stewie, citing his hilarious accent. 

One student raised her hand and asked if we would be doing our unit on Lenin today to which his response was Lenin! I need a HARD LENINADE and a beach day right about now. BEACH DAY EVERYDAY BEACH DAY EVERYDAY! while pumping his hands up and down. No one joined in. 

When the Stewie funny moments video finished, he actually pulled out what looked like a book from a library. But before he could start reading he exclaimed whoops gotta sanitize this first. He then reached into his bag and pulled out an open can of diet coke, dumping it all over the book completely ruining it. Meanwhile the youtube Autoplay had flipped to one of his recommended videos on the side bar, that being a Minecraft letsplay in German.

When the prof noticed this he just sat down and silently started watching this guy try and build a nether portal with lava and water buckets. It was by far one of my weirdest lectures. Some poor kid had his hand up for like the ENTIRE time but the prof just kept watching the fucking minecraft video. 

When that video ended he said just yelled LEAVE! and started doing the floss dance with a really angry face on. After I got home I saw an email from the prof and it was a link to him explaining how the red astronaut from Among Us is actually a representation of Karl Marx.

So yeah IDK what the hell that was, needless to say I WONT be going back next week. Its just so strange, the recorded lectures were completely normal then this!

McGill Fall 2021 UPDATE for inperson activities TownHall update,"Here are the slides open the thread about the possible scenarios pessimistic, realistic, optimistic for this fall, from todays town hall. Further updates will come in the following weeks and with monthly updates.

From the QA

 It is expected that all students be in Montreal this fall, even international International students will be able to get vaccinated in Canada, further details to come.
 Large classes like Leacock will be delivered remotely. For smaller classes 150, the default is expected to be inperson. A remote alternative is not expected to be available for all classes.
 It is expected that some exams will be inperson, in exam hubs TBF. There wont be inperson crowded field house exams though.
 A sudden redalert scenario is also planned, though it is really unlikely. The realistic and realistic scenarios are the ones being planned for the moment.
 Reminder The realistic scenarios may seem worrisome for some students, especially the ones at risk. However, all students or anyone in general having health conditions putting them at risk will be vaccinated before September.
 Extracurricular activities like frosh are part of the planning but wasnt the subject of todays town hall. Communications are made with student associations to plan and determine the likelihood of such event to happen they arent ignoring these activities but it is not the main focus.
 Graduate students hybrid models are currently being evaluated for PhD defence.

McGill will return to inperson teaching beginning in Fall 2021,"Dear members of the McGill community,
As we enter the final weeks of an extraordinary academic year, questions have naturally been raised about plans for 20212022.  We write to confirm that McGill will return to inperson teaching beginning in Fall 2021. While some components of courses will harness the pedagogical benefits of online teaching, students and teaching staff should plan for a return to more regular rhythms of oncampus academic activity by September. With this in mind, student residences will be open in Fall 2021 with the usual guarantee of accommodation to all eligible firstyear students who request it. We will likewise continue to develop plans for a progressive return to oncampus work for administrative and support staff, with the goal of achieving a regular presence by September 2021.
 
The health and wellbeing of our community will of course remain a top priority, and all necessary health and safety measures will continue to be implemented to ensure that our campuses remain safe places to learn and to work in the coming year. While the evolution of the public health situation in Quebec cannot be known with certainty, we are confident in our collective capacity to deliver academic programs and university services in a way that meets the standards of excellence expected of McGill University while continuing to ensure the safety of our community.
 
We appreciate that you will have questions in the coming weeks and months and we commit to providing regular updates as we prepare for a return to oncampus activity.
 
With best wishes,

Woke culture gone to far at McGill?,"This morning, I read yet another story in LaPresse about McGill and its managment of Academic FreedomEquity on campus. Let me summarize for our English speaking folks 

Last Fall, three weeks into the semester, a French Lit student was offended by the fact the Nword was written in a book from 1884 they had to read without being warned by the teacher. She complained to the teacher who, by accident, pronounced the word when apologizing to the class. She then decided to complain harshly to the McGill Administration and here is what they did
1 Allowed her to drop the class
2Reemboursed her for the class this was beyond the adddrop date
3 Gave her full credit for the class with her first assignment as the final grade remember that was in late September, during the Withdrawal period!

Am I wrong for feeling outraged by this?  This is embarrassing for the university and the value of our degree. Not only that, it is clearly unfair for all the students who attend their class like they should to get the full credit they earn... In fact, two McGill Professors denounced this decision by the University in the article.

For some reason, Anglophone media is more silent on the moralistic climate at McGill compared their Francophone counterparts, and I feel that the student community is not speaking a lot about those kind of events.

What do you guys think? Has woke culture gone to far?

A plea against datamatch on the eve of potentially the loneliest day of your year.,"This has been a long 11 months. Yahweh knows it has been. I could go on and on but your time is as important as mine so Ill cut to the chase. As some of you have noticed, Datamatch has recieved 4x the signups of last year  its pretty obvious as to why. Let us ignore for a moment just how insufferable and out of touch the questions were and look at why you need to not open that email when it comes through.

Dating apps prey on your own personality sense of insecurity and anxieties about whether or not youre a desirable human. As a consequence of the divorce of ownership and management e.g. Bumble went public yesterday, these companies are literally contractually obligated to manipulate your mental state as much as possible as that will maximise profit  which is what shareholders demand. Datamatch isnt public, not does it offer a pro version which is particularly damaging in that it gives credence to the idea that you can pay more money to become desireable in the eyes of others  literally equating wealth to being a desirable human being. It even offers to buy you a coffee or something. How cute. What we dont know is what were going to have done to all the private data weve willingly handed over in some loneliness induced spasm of needing to feel wanted. 

Servers cost money, this service will have taken a lot of time to put together. Where is it coming from? Its an incredibly opaque service that will be taking advantage of you in some undisclosed way. Like facebook, youtube, and twitter with their free at the point of access model, they necessarily create an unconventional monetisation method that will have disastrous consequences because of the inherent cost invovled with setting up such an endeavour. You are the product if you are not paying for it.

Instead of giving up your agency to some algorithm, reject this consumerist nightmare of a holiday designed to weaponse loneliness into purchasing stupid shit neither you nor your partner want and instead do something for yourself. Relationships shouldnt be about one day. They should be a perpetual  evovling commitment until they are no longer. Write out a list as to why you love yourself, and not subject yourself to the whims of others and their preferences. Love yourself, do not open that email when it comes through. Wait at least a day. Valentines day has signficance because you let it. 

In refusing to open this email and spending the day doing things you love to do yourself, you regain your power. Your own perception of your self worth ceases to become dependent on those around you. This will massively increase your own self worth, which in turn makes you more attractive. You will find the one your looking for, as they will find you as you succeed and succeed as a byproduct of the fact that you derive your own power from what you think of yourself, and not what others swipe or how an algorithm percieves your social standing. You deserve better. You are better. Do not open that email immediately. Take the time to reflect on what you love about yourself, think about how youre going to develop it and then open the email. I admit theres not much else to do these days, but you wont feel better or empowered by this event.

MyCourses Quiz FinalMidterms for a U0 Science Class,"One of my big U0 science classes is planning to do our midterms and final on MyCourses, which strikes me and some other students as weird. All of our other larger classes have had the big assessments on Crowdmark, but our professor says that there are not enough TAs for this course unfortunately. They agree that its not ideal since we cant get part marks or anything. The quiz format means that about 80 of our final grade would then be multiple choice or fillintheblank questions, so cheating would be even easier.

TO ALL YOU PEOPLE STILL BEHINDDONT WORRY STAY STRONG U STILL HAVE TIME.,"Hello, I am a very behind person right now. Like behind on all my classes, hit the ground running and failed to keep that momentum going and am in a bit of a sticky situation.

But Id just like to say that its still very possible as of now to still catchup even if slowly. Prioritize shit that has assignments coming up. The important thing to remember is to just start, no matter what and if its readingslectures you need to catch up on as long as you just get a rudementary understanding of them youll be fine. Even the on top of everything students rarely completly understand the readings or the lecture content. As long as you get a good idea of it and commit it to that secondary long term memory youll be fine. 

Were only like a month in to everything so dont worry relax, youll be fine. Just start, make some sacrifices and itll all be ok. I promise, well all make it through this semester one way or another. Soon well all be back on campus, youll be vaccinated and hey even if you did fail a class I promise you it wont be that bad. Do you know how many ppl are failingdroppingoutstruggling rn? Eeveryone knows it dont be hard on yourself.

Sorry if this sounds like a blank inspirational post but honestly when Im behind seeing confirmation online that others are in my position or worse helps and gives me hope. So if your behind, like me comment below pls. It really helps people to let them know that their grievances are not felt alone. That others are in your position.

I have to say, Im really proud of Legault for predicting this situation and acting proactively to act against it.

Open letter regarding Professor Douglas Farrow,"Our open letter regarding Professor Douglas Farrow

  
resources for students and a link to the Google document version of this statement with hyperlinks are below

  
To the School of Religious Studies

  
We are writing to you today to express concern over publications and comments made by Professor Douglas B. Farrow, a theology professor within the School of Religious Studies SRS, which we feel are both troubling and exclusionary. Dr. Farrow has been employed at McGills SRS since 1997, before many of SRSs students were even born. During that time, many students of the McGill community have deemed Dr. Farrows academic approach and perspectives on gender and sexuality as creating exclusionary and unsafe environments in his classes for members of the LGBTQ community.

  
Dr. Farrow teaches Principles of Christian Theology 2 RELG 434 and Theological Ethics RELG 470 in the Fall semester and is currently teaching Principles of Theology 1 RELG 333 and Christian Thought and Culture RELG 334 during the Winter semester. Three of these courses are required for the Bachelor of Theology B.Th. program and the topics of these classes are of interest to many Bachelor of Arts B.A. students in the SRS. The fact that Dr. Farrow teaches three mandatory classes is of great concern to the student body, as we would hope that both McGill and the SRS prioritize the wellbeing of their marginalized students.

  
Many of Dr. Farrows publications are on display in the Birks lobby, of which Nation of Bastards Essays on the End of Marriagehttpsmcgill.on.worldcat.orgoclc213413669, we feel, is particularly troubling. In this book, Dr. Farrow refers to samesex marriage as a casualty that has reduced both the institution of marriage as well as the family. He writes that samesex marriage makes bastards of us all, which marks an important milestone on the path to state tyranny. It is difficult to read this quotation without immediately perceiving it as a deliberate homophobic attack, which he reiterates in his article Happy Canada Day, Bastards!httpswww.firstthings.comwebexclusives201507happycanadadaybastards, written in reaction to the landmark Supreme Court decision in the United States legalizing gay marriage.

  
Dr. Farrow continues his arguments against gay marriage in Desiring a Better Countryhttpswww.mqup.cadesiringabettercountryproducts9780773545854.php. In Theological Negotiationshttpbakerpublishinggroup.combookstheologicalnegotiations391101, he asserts that he uses gendered language freely because God made man male and female. This rhetoric is exclusionary to transgender and gendernonconforming students. It makes members of the LBGTQ community feel unsafe in and marginalized by the SRS and severely undermines the inclusivity of both the SRS and McGill at large.

  
Dr. Farrows publications are just the beginning of his outward displays of bigoted views. In 2017, he was a panellist on the topic of Gender Mainstreaming and Transgender, which was protested by a group of transgender studentshttpswww.mcgilldaily.com201702protestorsdisrupttransphobictalk from QPIRG, Queer McGill, and the Union for Gender Empowerment. The subject of the talk became a webpage called Gender Mainstreaminghttpweb.archive.orgweb20190928182116httpswww.mcgill.caprppgendermainstreaming as a part of a website run by Dr. Farrow titled Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy hosted by the McGill website. This page discussed gender transition with outrageous comments such as Dave the Rapist can return as Rene the ravishing. The website has since been taken down by the McGill administration at the request of a concerned individual, however these views were permitted by both the School and the University to be published and continue to be espoused by him within the SRS.

  
While many of Dr. Farrows publications were published a number of years ago, it was only in recent years that McGill has begun to facilitate safe and open discourse on topics such as gender identity and sexual orientation, with initiatives such as the It Takes All of Ushttpswww.mcgill.cafirstyearundergraduateyourfirstyearittakesallusonlineeducationprogram campaign. As student representatives, we have taken upon ourselves this academic year to support our LGBTQ students as much as possible, through initiatives such as creating gender neutral washrooms in Birks. Our work would be incomplete if we did not extend this to the classrooms, and as such, we now find it necessary to voice our concerns.

  
From an academic standpoint, we are concerned by Dr. Farrows narrow approach to his teaching, in which he permits and validates a limited number of perspectives while belittling most others. Based on his course readings, Dr. Farrow provides his students with a very particular perspective both on Christian theology and Christian understanding of gender and sexuality, which not only prevents a diverse learning environment, but also makes numerous students feel victimized by many of the views expressed by Dr. Farrow.

  
This alone is cause for concern, but even more than these methodological issues, the perspectives, opinions, and identities that Dr. Farrow deliberately excludes and denigrates are in direct violation of McGills Principles of Equality and Inclusivity, McGills Policy on Harassment and Discrimination bylaw, SSMUs Equity Policy, and SSMUs Academic Accessibility Policy. These policies and laws ensure the protection of all individuals within the McGill community and, as such, must be upheld and promoted in practice, not just in writing.

  
In all four of his syllabi for the 20192020 academic year, such as the RELG 333 syllabushttpswww.mcgill.careligiousstudiesfilesreligiousstudiesrelg333w20201.pdf, Dr. Farrow refers to his policy regarding PFNP, McGills Preferred First Name Policyhttpsreporter.mcgill.catherighttobeyourself. In Dr. Farrows policy, he states that no one is required to adopt views, claims, or linguistic forms with which they disagree. Although he requests that everyone maintain traditional standards of civility, the problem lies in the belief that one can simply disagree with a students gender identity and expression. Names and pronouns are not preferred, they are required. While Dr. Farrow has the right to disagree with PFNP, he cannot disregard the fundamental rights of all studentsincluding the right to freely express gender identitynor can he circumvent McGill policy.

  
Dr. Farrow has been revered by the SRS for his contributions to the study of theology, despite the blatant, discriminatory views entrenched in his work. While the students and faculty within the SRS are entitled to hold personal opinions, this reverence has exceeded personal respect Dr. Farrows publications, which are further elaborated below, are on display in the Birks Building lobby. This suggests that such discriminatory views are openly accepted by the administration, despite facilitating a hostile environment for many marginalized students.

  
According to the definition of academic freedom of McGill and many other academic institutions, Dr. Farrow has the right to express and publish any views that he may hold. That said, no ones freedoms, academic or otherwise, should encroach on anothers. As such, having Dr. Farrow teach courses that are mandatory for B.Th students, such as theological ethics, forces students into an environment that denies the dignity of their identity and personhood, thus making the SRS inaccessible and unsafe to the many LGBTQ students in the SRS. In other words, just as Dr. Farrow has the right to freedom of speech, students have the right to a safe and inclusive learning environment.

  
Furthermore, Dr. Farrows discourse not only denies the legitimacy of LGTBQ identity, but for those who are still struggling with understanding their own identity, his discriminatory language can be traumatic, particularly when the topics of the courses involve the concept of God, faith, and the understanding of identities in a theological framework. For these reasons, Dr. Farrows unfiltered and unapologetic perpetuation of heavily prejudiced views, which he attempts to justify under the guise of free speech, must be responsibly addressed.

  
Given the numerous examples and comments that we have highlighted in this letter, we, the undersigned, are offering our full support to students who have been targeted by Dr. Farrows system of discriminatory beliefs. To this end, we request that the SRS provide students greater flexibility in their course choice by assigning additional professors to the mandatory classes that are currently taught exclusively by Dr. Farrow. Many of Dr. Farrows classes have been taught by other professors in the past, and we hope that similar changes can be made again. We also call on the SRS to remove his homophobic and transphobic works from the display cases in the Birks lobby.

  
McGill and the SRS can use this opportunity to demonstrate their support for students by affirming that marginalization on the part of professors will not be tolerated. While it is important to maintain academic freedom, students should have the freedom to feel safe and welcome in their classrooms, and we implore the SRS and McGill to take the steps necessary to ensure this.

2021 MEGATHREAD Prospective or Incoming Student Questions All other posts will be REMOVED," 

Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and were here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please read the FAQs below, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to Service Pointhttpswww.mcgill.caservicepoint.

You might also try asking your question herehttpask.mcgill.ca on the McGill website.

What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?

We arent admissions officers, so we cant tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the minimum requirementshttpswww.mcgill.caapplyingrequirements for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the sooner youre likely to hear backhttpswww.mcgill.caapplyingnextstepsdecision.

However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

If I dont meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, its a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

What if Im accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, youll be fine.

Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?

Most of us havent attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably cant give you an informed opinion.

How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? Ive heard theres grade deflation.

Its hardMcGill will not hold your handbut its also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a classs grades down so that theres a certain average also known as grade deflation.

What is student life like?

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. Read through some past threadshttpswww.reddit.comrmcgillsearch?qstudentlifeflair3ASSMUrestrictsronsortrelevancetall to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen offcampus. There is a visible party culture, so if thats up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures sometimes as low as 30 C with wind chill, and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speakor make an effort to learnun peu de franais.

Ive accepted my offer! What next?

Dude creeping on me from one of my classes,"So I received a request on messenger from a guy in one of my classes with your classic are you in this class message.  I didnt see it until today when I got an email to my McGill email from the same guy that basically said hes seen me on Zoom in class and since Ive ignored his messenger text hes sent me an email to tell me hes in love with me and we should have a conversation and basically a lot of other creepy, boundarycrossing stuff.

Its a small class with frequent breakout room meetings, so I think Im going to email the prof just to request we are never placed in the same room together. Ive never been in this situation so if anybody has any advice on what I should do that would be great. For reference, we arent in the same city so Im not worried about running into him or anything. Also, if anybody knows what I should do if this were to escalate, that would be helpful as well.

Thanks everyone!

Quebec Residency Status Loophole?,"Hey, pretty McGillians. I was just speaking with a former McGill student, and they gave me a very interesting insight with regard to Quebec Residency status.

They told me that I can essentially use my parents names for a lease, so instead of me, a student, renting property, it will be theirs instead. That means that instead of me being a resident of another province, Im now a Quebec resident because Im their child. I can then just reimburse my parents on the charges for that lease.

Can anyone corroborate this? If so, this is a great loophole to avoid paying outofprovince tuition.

"So long, and thanks for all the samosas","Hey rmcgill,

Six years ago, my parents dragged me to Montreal over winter break and insisted on signing us up for a tour of a very good school called McGill. I was in grade 10 and couldnt be less interested. Then I slipped and fell on the ice. Also, half the campus was torn up for construction. I should have taken these as omens, but I didnt.  

The name McGill stuck with me, so I put it on my college list, because Id always had a passing fascination with Canada note not implying that Quebec is part of Canada, they didnt demand any essays, and the tuition was cheap thanks to the exchange rate. Then Trmp got elected and suddenly Montreal in December looked positively sunny indeed.

Three years of trudging through the slush to get to class later, The Donald is mercifully on his way out, Ive graduated, and after taking a break from Reddit, I realized I completely forgot to say goodbye! At least for now I would like to come back for grad school in a couple years. Still, how rude of me.

As my parting gift, I would like to impart some sage alumnus advice. Unfortunately a lot of it doesnt apply so long as youre stuck paying full price for Zoom classes, but you can file it away for better times

1. Super Sandwich. Learn where this is. I didnt until my second year. Big mistake.

2. Make good use of Kanopy and the other goodies you get with your library login.

3. La meilleure faon dapprendre le franais est de consommer les mdias qubcois.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v4IHnFvyr0P4

4. Master the tunnels from 688 Sherbrooke to McGill metro, and the Scotiabank tower to Peel metro.

5. The keys to surviving winter are wearing layers, and knowing when to walk on the snow to avoid the ice.

6. If youre not in GEOG, do NOT use the GIC. On the other hand, you should totally take a GEOG class. I recommend 201.

7. The true point of attending office hours is not to ask for help, but to suck up so theyll mark you more favourably later on.

8. Get a monthly STM pass and use it to visit the following Espace pour la vie, SaintHenri, Little Italy, and CtedesNeiges.

9. No more SSMU drama. Society has progressed beyond the need for SSMU drama.

10. Youre probably not going to be one of the cool kids, so stop trying to fake it and find your own niche.

Well, thats all for now. Feel free to PM me if you want more GEOG or JWST course recommendations, or if you want to offer me a job. Either works.

Management is the worst faculty,"Is it just me or does management seem like a joke  coming from a second year Desautels kid. Here are some of my thoughts

1 No matter what you want to major in as a management student, there is a better option outside of the faculty. Finance, operations, business analytics, and any other quant major is basically applied stats. Why shouldnt I just go learn stats and actually learn the theory  principles behind any managerial application. Organization and strategy is just applied psychology and sociology, except its riddled with bs and outdated research. Marketing, international business, retail, entrepreneurship, and HR dont really have fundamental skills you need for the field BEYOND 23 classes. I guess if u want to do accounting u need to go to desautels though. Management info systems is a complete joke  its everything but programming in a comp sci degree, so every useless managerial aspect in dev  IT from looking at user requirements to installing crm.

2 Its so easy. Like it seems so easy to pass any class just by even putting a bit of attention into the courses. If you want to do well, you literally just have to memorize a few concepts or apply some basic math. You dont need to do any critical thinking, heavy analysis, or even significant computation. Its so much easier than math, comp, nursing, any science, neuro, etc... You could probably wing ur way through a bcomm without studying a minute and pass if ur smart enough. To get a high grade... you really dont have to work that hard, practice a lot, have high attention to detail, or refine your writing  analytical  essay skills. If youre in management and screaming at me right now, have u tried taking science classes, math classes, or even arts classes out of desautels? Go take like comp 202, phys 101, math 133, comp 206, or math 141... all these U0 freshman classes are harder than many 300400 level management cores. I swear on my life that I worked so much harder in high school and actually used my brain so much more than I do now. I feel like my brain is losing its ability to think critically and work hard getting through these core classes.

3 Everyone has a kind of snob and competitiveness that is unlike anywhere else. We act like we are geniuses that will make millions being your boss, but we really arent that smart or successful. Maybe its the curve, but people in management tend to help each other a lot less than people in every other faculty. 

4 The curve to 72.577.5 for almost all classes.

5 Im pretty sure Desautels is one of the most old fashioned faculty and admin. From career advisors telling your class that they dont speak asian, to having dated curriculum and courses, to having a lack of actual research, to teaching about cross cultural management aka cultural stereotypes.

Anyways, I may hate all this about Desautels, but at least its more employable than most arts or science degrees and I dont know what I want to do with my life.... so Ill be staying here for now.",1608364274,152,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/kg3rdr/management_is_the_worst_faculty/,86,justin670,kg3rdr,12/19/2020 7:51,"['management', 'seem', 'like', 'joke', 'coming', 'second', 'year', 'desautels', 'kid.', 'thoughts', 'matter', 'want', 'major', 'management', 'student', 'better', 'option', 'outside', 'faculty.', 'finance', 'operations', 'business', 'analytics', 'quant', 'major', 'basically', 'applied', 'stats.', 'shouldnt', 'go', 'learn', 'stats', 'actually', 'learn', 'theory', 'principles', 'behind', 'managerial', 'application.', 'organization', 'strategy', 'applied', 'psychology', 'sociology', 'except', 'riddled', 'bs', 'outdated', 'research.', 'marketing', 'international', 'business', 'retail', 'entrepreneurship', 'hr', 'dont', 'really', 'fundamental', 'skills', 'need', 'field', 'beyond', 'classes.', 'guess', 'u', 'want', 'accounting', 'u', 'need', 'go', 'desautels', 'though.', 'management', 'info', 'systems', 'complete', 'joke', 'everything', 'programming', 'comp', 'sci', 'degree', 'every', 'useless', 'managerial', 'aspect', 'dev', 'looking', 'user', 'requirements', 'installing', 'crm.', 'easy.', 'like', 'seems', 'easy', 'pass', 'class', 'even', 'putting', 'bit', 'attention', 'courses.', 'want', 'well', 'literally', 'memorize', 'concepts', 'apply', 'basic', 'math.', 'dont', 'need', 'critical', 'thinking', 'heavy', 'analysis', 'even', 'significant', 'computation.', 'much', 'easier', 'math', 'comp', 'nursing', 'science', 'neuro', 'etc...', 'could', 'probably', 'wing', 'ur', 'way', 'bcomm', 'without', 'studying', 'minute', 'pass', 'ur', 'smart', 'enough.', 'get', 'high', 'grade...', 'really', 'dont', 'work', 'hard', 'practice', 'lot', 'high', 'attention', 'detail', 'refine', 'writing', 'analytical', 'essay', 'skills.', 'youre', 'management', 'screaming', 'right', 'u', 'tried', 'taking', 'science', 'classes', 'math', 'classes', 'even', 'arts', 'classes', 'desautels?', 'go', 'take', 'like', 'comp', 'phys', 'math', 'comp', 'math', '...', 'u', 'freshman', 'classes', 'harder', 'many', 'level', 'management', 'cores.', 'swear', 'life', 'worked', 'much', 'harder', 'high', 'school', 'actually', 'used', 'brain', 'much', 'now.', 'feel', 'like', 'brain', 'losing', 'ability', 'think', 'critically', 'work', 'hard', 'getting', 'core', 'classes.', 'everyone', 'kind', 'snob', 'competitiveness', 'unlike', 'anywhere', 'else.', 'act', 'like', 'geniuses', 'make', 'millions', 'boss', 'really', 'arent', 'smart', 'successful.', 'maybe', 'curve', 'people', 'management', 'tend', 'help', 'lot', 'less', 'people', 'every', 'faculty.', 'curve', '..', 'almost', 'classes.', 'im', 'pretty', 'sure', 'desautels', 'one', 'old', 'fashioned', 'faculty', 'admin.', 'career', 'advisors', 'telling', 'class', 'dont', 'speak', 'asian', 'dated', 'curriculum', 'courses', 'lack', 'actual', 'research', 'teaching', 'cross', 'cultural', 'management', 'aka', 'cultural', 'stereotypes.', 'anyways', 'may', 'hate', 'desautels', 'least', 'employable', 'arts', 'science', 'degrees', 'dont', 'know', 'want', 'life....', 'ill', 'staying', 'now.']",1,0,1,0

"New SU policy for fall 2020 and winter 2021, how about 2020 summer that has already passed?","Copypasted 

At the Senate meeting on December 2, there were discussions regarding the feasibility of extending the SatisfactoryUnsatisfactory or SU option for the current academic year. The University and student associations are currently collaborating on a proposal, which will then be brought forward to Senate early next week. The elements of the additional SU option in this proposal state that, exceptionally for the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 terms, and where permitted by Faculty regulations and program requirements

students may take up to a total of 6 credits over the two terms to be graded as SU under this Additional SU Option
these credits may be associated with elective, complementary, or required courses
credits designated as SU under this Additional SU Option do not count toward the maximum specified by the existing SU option 10 of the credits taken at McGill to fulfil the degree requirements and
students will be able to choose this SU option after grades are postedfor the current Fall term, this means selection can be done in early January for the Winter term, selection will be in early May. 
We will update the community as soon as there is a decision regarding the feasibility or implementation of this proposal.

END OF EMAIL

Just to point out that, wouldnt it be unfair for those who took courses over last summer 2020 summer? Since all three online semesters winter 2020fall 2020winter 2021  all have a late SU option once the decision has been made but I dont recall one for the summer.

 you were not able to participate in overhyped campus events because you had to work preCOVID
 your university experience is not what you expected it to be or like the movies make it look like its supposed to be
 youre battling with your mental health right now
 youve had to take some time off school to take care of yourself or someone you love
 you hate your program or you didnt graduate with a degree in your program of choice
 it took you a bit longer than your peers to graduate 
 youre not a fan of zoom university
 you are having a good time at uni, but just dont have the pictures or instagram posts to prove it
 even preCOVID, you really just wanted the degree. not the parties, not the stereotypical unhealthy lifestyle, just the degree.
 youre giving uni your best, but still havent found your passion or your purpose
 you feel FOMO because you are doing your bit to stay safe and not put others at risk during this pandemic 
 youre giving it your best, but still havent found an internship or a job
 youre giving your studies your best, but your GPA doesnt reflect it
 youve found out that a lot of your thoughts, beliefs and perspectives on certain issues are unpopular and sometimes you find yourself in a lonely fight for the things that matter to you
 you feel out of place with other students of the same age, race, or nationality as you
 you didnt fall in love with your city like others did or didnt even get to experience the city this semester
 youve changed your major like 5 times
 youve outgrown your friends
 zoom uni made you realize you had more acquaintances than friends
 youre olderyounger than most people in your program
 zoom uni has you feeling disconnected from the university life

Only 26 of McGill Econ students are satisfied with their program... and no one is surprised,"Results from a student survey conducted last year were released this week by the club Expanding Economics expandingeconomics.comreporthttpsexpandingeconomics.comreport and they pretty much summarise my experience with the department so far. 

Most disturbingly

 Less than 13 of students report that their knowledge about the structure and characteristics of the Canadian economy has improved despite studying economics at a top Canadian university ??!!  
 Less than 30 of students feel their economics courses have helped them understand the economic implications of climate change

Ive been disappointed by McGills economics courses since my first year. Its pretty much common knowledge among students that you wont be learning how to analyze real economic data, or be asked to compare economic perspectives in any of the required courses. Maaaaaybe youll touch on these things in a 300 or 400level if you choose the right courses or get a good prof but so many students are turned off of the discipline far before this. 

I dont know if the department will listen to the findings given that the survey was conducted by students, but its honestly pretty appalling that so many students are paying so much and struggling to do well in courses with insane grading schemes and not even walking out of them with an understanding of the real world??

You consider burning it, as a token of your symbolic escape from the eternal prison they call MyCourses. No, you need to focus on your work, no procrastination! You keep writing, but your eyes feel heavy, your hands sore from taking notes so sloppy you might as well just snort the ink and sneeze on the notebook. You find yourself daydreaming of a better world, devoid of zoom classes and full of reading weeks. You havent noticed yet, but your head is gently descending onto the desk. As your eyes shut you utter the name of Big Suze, in hopes of salvation.

The sudden change of smell brings you to your senses. The sweet scent of pine cones surrounds you amidst the gentle embrace of the warm spring weather. Before opening your eyes, you spend a moment to take it all in. You dont know where you are, you dont dare ruin the illusion. Yet an alluring flash of green penetrates your eyelids. You instinctively take a step forward and immediately lose your balance. Startled, you open your eyes as you slip, to reveal the stunning view youre surrounded by, a beautiful green sea of leaves atop countless trees, each more magnificent than the last . You quickly get a hold of the branch you are on with your tiny paws. You let out a huge sigh of relief as you remember. You are a squirrel. It was all just a bad dream. You check your mental todo list consisting of one item and one item only. This one seems much more manageable now, doesnt it?

Funny story I have from my job working at a gardening store,"So basically there I am minding my own business sitting behind the counter at my gardening store and then I see this guy in a McGill hoodie walk into the store. Now I went to McGill so I was like hey thats cool you know another guy from McGill.

Anyway he walks up to the counter and he asks me what are the best vegetables that would impress the ladies I responded  what what are you talking about? Can you be a bit more specific and he tells me basically theres this girl that always sits in the cafeteria at Milton B that I really want to impress. so I thought what do girls like more than vegetables? absolutely nothing. so Im just looking if you know which of the specific vegetables in the store would be best to impress women with. 

Anyway I gave him a bunch of zucchinis cucumbers tomatoes and basil to be honest I just kind of picked them out at random. He spent over 4,000 at my store though looking for equipment to build the perfect lady picking up garden. 

it was just a really weird experience from another McGill student, before he left he asked me for directions to the photography store. I think hes pretty serious about this.

Essays written at the last minute without a single set of page of consecutive pages written but somehow I manage to produce some sketchy zombie paper strewn together with random bits of class content, bottom of Wikipedia sources and general knowledge.

 On top of that being isolated I really feel like a mad fucking scientist, just pumping out these halfliving monster papers clinging on for life. In a constant state of misery.

It took a little longer to post it on here compared to other social media platforms, so some of you might have already seen it going around. As Im writing this post, we already have more than 2200 signatories!

I kindly ask you all to read the petition and, in case you agree, to sign it and send it to your fellow students, profs or even parents.

Please please take care of your mental health and reach out if you ever need help,"My boyfriend just recently had an almost successful suicide attempt and it had shaken me to the core. I have been asking him to reach out for professional help which he had brushed off and told me that he did not need it. He had received professional help after he got to the ER and is doing better now. It also made me realize how fickle my mental health is currently as well as everyone out there who do not take our mental health as seriously as we should be.

It had been a stressful year and I hope everyone is staying safe and staying sane. Please do not think your mental health is not important and just shove it under the carpet to finish the many assignments that we have. If you ever need help, please do not ever hesitate to reach out and ask for it. I do care for you. You matter. Many many people care for you and I hope you can make it out of whatevers affecting you.

Anyone wanna fuckin uhhh...,"...bump into each other while walking on Parc Avenue, spilling everything we were holding all over the place, then awkwardly try to pick it all up, and as we reach for the same Tims Everything Bagel we lock eyes, all of a sudden everything just stops. No more corona, no more quarantine, no more assignments, no more MyCourses, no more of this endless ever growing abyss that consumes even the last bits of hope we didnt even know we had. Even the sound of the homeless people yelling at us for three fiddy in the background and the war cries of the seagulls planning their assault on the precious loot appearing right in front of their beaks, muffled by the intensity of our gaze. We feel a familiar warmth, like a leaf bathing in the sun right before it catches fire, oblivious to the destruction it will bring to the forest that is our souls. In that instant, we realize how futile our efforts have been so far, all this time wasted trying to pursue an idea of happiness that existed only in our minds, when all we needed was this mere moment. To your surprise, I quietly let go and concede the Bagel. I have no need for it anymore. We apologize and move on. Except I havent moved on, only walked away, away from where every inch of my body tells me I should be. I have no idea whether you feel the same, and I dont dare make the assumption. All I know is that life is now better, for in that instant I saw in your eyes what couldve been, a sliver of hope that warms my heart frozen by the brutal winds of life.

Interest in petition for a longer winter break,"Im putting this here to see how many studentsprofs would be willing to sign a formal petition in order to get a longer winter break this year.

Other universities across the provinces have found ways to lengthen their winter break for this year, while ours is going to last 12 days, which is a whole 4 days SHORTER than last year. 

This is mainly due to the fact that the admin makes their calendar 34 years in advance which is also why its so hard to get a fall reading week. They evidently couldnt plan for a whole ass pandemic then, but with how slow things have been moving adminwise its pretty certain nothings gonna change if we dont do something. Exceptional times that calls for exceptional student mobilization. 

The SSMU will be meeting the Deputy Provost of Student Life and Learning later this week to bring this issue forward, but a petition is still a good idea and would definitely help bring more attention to this.

I Just Realized Winter Break is Shorter This Year!,"This year we only have 12 days off Dec 23 to Jan 3.

In comparison, last year we had 16 days off Dec 21 to Jan 5.

I know its only 4 days but considering how intensive this online semester has been it still sucks. So many people have been talking about burning out this semester, I wish we had a longer break before starting another online semester.

The student council at Carleton University was able to get their school to extend the winter break by a week. The extra week theyre giving isnt just to give students more time off to decompress, but its also to give teachers more time to change the curriculum to better match the capabilities of students during online semesters.

Today, though, it was pretty awesome.","Im a native English speaker trying to learn a language that follows an entirely different alphabetical system. I can barely read in English sometimes my comprehension is fine but Im so slow that when tested, I scored in the 7th percentile, which is really, really bad so its not much of a shocker that learning to read in different languages has always been less than an ideal experience for me.

I frequently have mini panic attacks when Im asked a reading based question in class and itd be even worse if Im asked to read from the board I am usually literally unable to read from the board because I cant read most peoples handwriting so I pretty much look like a colossal idiot whenever Im asked a question its also harder for me to read under stress so its just doubly terrible. If I do manage to answer, its usually a traumatic experience because everyone in the class now knows I read at the speed of a 2 year old and literally sound shit out depending on how stressed I am.

Ive had a lot of issues with writing as well. I flip characters around often, I randomly insert English characters into the script this is remarkable achievement considering how different the characters are and, I chronically misspell words a common issue for me even when Im using English. 

Despite all this, the two profs that have taught me this subject have been amazing. Theyve patiently waited for me to finish reading something at my painfully slow pace, they stopped asking me to read from the board they figured out I cant read handwriting and no longer ask me to and, being somehow capable of recognizing my distress, theyve never pressured me to answer a question and have worked out ways to seamlessly move on with the lesson when I cant answer something.

Today, however, has been particularly special because somehow, after 1.5 years of commitment, I apparently have the best handwriting in the class and my homework has become a joy to mark.

Guys. What?

Again, what?

My handwriting was literally unintelligible. It was so bad, that my first professor was incapable of deciphering what he was reading which likely guarantees that he didnt enjoy my homework. I literally couldnt read a single world in this language for 7 weeks when every other student knew the entire alphabet, and could read, on the very first day. It was humiliating. Im actually still embarrassed. 

It was and is easy for people to assume that Im just lazy and yes, I know people think this for a fact because fellow students have said so directly. This couldnt be further from the truth. 

Ive always know when Im behind, I always am, and Ive always hated it. It probably didnt look like it then or now, but Ive consistently done everything in my power to keep up with the rest of you guys even to the point of an actual mental breakdown one semester but I simply couldnt do it general ineptitude is a common theme for me. 

I put an insane amount of work into this course. I jeopardized my marks in other classes to do so. Honestly, it feels like I studied more than every student in the history of this university just to catch up, and then I never realized it when I did. 

Basically what Im saying is that this course was agonizing and Im now apparently one of the best students in the class. Im floored. Im so used to being last place that I didnt even let myself see that Id improved at something. Its normal for me to put in more work than others just to meet the norm. Its rare that my colossal efforts result in me being exceptional and its so much more meaningful to have that hard work pay off in a course that I had such a slow start in.

Im so grateful to have had professors that are able to work with me and my abnormally dysfunctional brain, rather than expecting me to be like everyone else or assuming im lazy. My current prof didnt even believe that Id ever struggled in this course. It feels amazing to be recognized for practically the first time.  Ive always been really insecure about my learning disabilities Im used to people assuming inaccurate things and it sometimes feels like Im broadcasting the fact that Im dumb. Im so glad my profs never assumed I was lazy like so many others. Im excited just to be this happy. Its rare that Im proud of myself and it feels so good to finally feel like I deserve to be here.

This became a lot longer than anticipated sorry guys. Thanks for humouring me and reading it all. I just thought that this sub might enjoy some positivity considering how hard the online semester has been.

"I am so mad at profs who are like I only give As very exceptionally, and only for perfect work. Arts","Like what in the flying hell is ur point as a professor if thats the case? An A is 85, which is nowhere near perfect. If ur a prof reading this, and most of your students are regularly getting Cs and you take pride in giving out only the very rare occasional A, why?

1 Why make it that much harder to get a good grade during a pandemic, at an already difficult as all hell school?

2 You, as a prof, are failing your students. You are doing something wrong. You are here to enrich the students learning experiences, and enable them to get the best grade possible. So if your students are constantly getting Cs with no improvement cuz you have some stupid idea of average, YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. You are failing at teaching, and you should not be proud of that. A C is 5 away from failing. At this point, it looks like youre just giving everyone Cs to make sure you have enough people that pass the class. Everybody being 5 from failing is NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT, PROFESSOR. It is literally the biggest failure that, you, as a professor, can achieve. Why? Because youre LITERALLY FAILING AT TEACHING. 

Sincerely,
A really, really, fed up Arts student.

McGill is forcing departments to have 2550 students in inperson classes for winter 2020,"We got this email this morning, and the general consensus among the profs and grad students is outrage about how ridiculous this is. There isnt enough time to reorganize courses so that it is taught in person, let alone plan out how this can be done safely. It seems like this is done because McGill is seeing more people taking the winter semester off and this last minute and dangerous course change is done solely for .


Dear all,

At todays Faculty of Science Town Hall it was announced that McGill plans to roll out  as much as possible l inperson, oncampus teaching activities starting in January 2021.

Chairs have been asked to submit a list of teachable courses, to be finalized by Tuesday next week.

After a prescreening with associate deans we have assessed the courses highlighted in yellow table below as potentially and partially teachable on campus. This assessment was targeting courses in the intermediate enrollment range about 20100. Larger courses should check if some elements e.g., tutorials might be offered on campus.

This is a very sudden development and probably unexpected with the background of the extended red alert situation in the Montreal region.

Edit This was an email sent to the profs and graduate students in order to gauge the mood and plan the list to send to the faculty.

I was finally able to send my teacher an email saying that Id picked my presentation date  a task I was expected to complete over month ago...,"Edit the title should say presentation topic, not presentation date.

I have ADHD and Im dyslexic. My reading comprehension is fine but Im so incredibly slow at reading that I scored in the 7th percentile when tested. For those of you who dont know what that means, just know that its really, really bad. 

Im in a field thats super reading heavy. It only works out cuz I spend 34x likely more tbh the amount of time on my readings as other students. Im usually able to handle this but recently I just couldnt. I couldnt keep my eyes on the page. I couldnt stop my train of thoughts. I was failing to recognize simple words and I had 7 other things I also needed to get done. Ultimately, I just wasnt able to do it within a timeframe that came anywhere close to reasonable and, one whole month later, I finally fucking read all the damn readings and picked the one I wanted. 

I didnt think I was going to get any sympathy for this. I fully expected and deserved to lose marks but despite being super anxious I somehow managed to actually send my prof the damn email yesterday. 

I told him about how my ADHD and dyslexia have been making it really hard for me to, well, read. I threw in some self deprecation and several apologies. I fully prepped myself to get written offpenalized. Instead, I got the nicest possible reply and it warmed my heart. 

This prof had voluntarily given me an extension for a different assignment I didnt even ask for but definitely needed, told me not to worry about this in the future and communicate my issues instead, and asked me if there was anything else he could do to help me.

Who does that? I ghosted for a month but was given a free extension anyway and then he offered to do even more!? Its nice to see that this kind of tolerance exists and at a university level.

SSMU taking sides in an international conflicts.,"
Hello,

SSMU posted an extremely provocative post where they call for a recognition of a disputed area between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 

DISCLAIMER I am not here to discuss who is right or who is wrong. Not gonna reply to any armenians or discuss.

The only reason I am posting here is the fact that I am outraged of how unprofessional the SSMU is. I am a student from Azerbaijan, my fellow Azeri and Turkish students are extremely offended by the fact that SSMU, who is supposed to represent all of us takes sides in such a complex political issue.

I think that the university society should urge them to stay neutral in such matters! It is not a world against terrorism it is a conflict between 2 UN countries where a lot of people are dying on both sides and both countries have students here.

The tilt making every step follow without effort

Id reflect on the concepts Id just been taught

In that huge and intimidating lecture hall

Densely filled with a beautiful variety of students from all over 

The Qubcois

Who didnt need to worry about making friends

Or staying warm, or learning French

The Canadians from out of province

Comfortable in their seats and very expressive

The Americans 

With their transparent Starbucks cups

I thought it was just a stereotype

But there they were, with their green mermaids

The rich Chinese

With their fur coats and their expensive phones

I tried to glance at a screen once

And the UI was in Mandarin

There wasnt a single nation

Who hadnt sent its talented children

Theyd be walking around campus

Proudly wearing McGill merch

Bumping into each other along McTavish

Knowing they had no chance 

Of making it on time for class

Within that ten minutes break

Especially if they had been cursed with a class in McIntyre

x200B

I miss walking across the lower campus

After a stressful midterm

The skyscrapers staring at me from afar

If I was lucky enough

The path wasnt under construction

And neither was the rest of the city

Id encounter a few curious tourists

Taking pictures of the Arts Building

Then Id leave through the Roddick Gates

Beautifully illuminated in red

x200B

I pity this years entering students

Who havent tasted their alma maters actual milk

And who have been offered a powdered alternative instead

That doesnt even come close to the real thing",1602813573,315,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/jc11ti/you_know_what_i_miss/,23,idrinkeverclear,jc11ti,10/16/2020 1:59,"['miss', 'smelling', 'fresh', 'air', 'autumn', 'night', 'would', 'fall', 'earlier', 'day', 'right', 'last', 'lecture', 'walking', 'university', 'street', 'tilt', 'making', 'every', 'step', 'follow', 'without', 'effort', 'id', 'reflect', 'concepts', 'id', 'taught', 'huge', 'intimidating', 'lecture', 'hall', 'densely', 'filled', 'beautiful', 'variety', 'students', 'qubcois', 'didnt', 'need', 'worry', 'making', 'friends', 'staying', 'warm', 'learning', 'french', 'canadians', 'province', 'comfortable', 'seats', 'expressive', 'americans', 'transparent', 'starbucks', 'cups', 'thought', 'stereotype', 'green', 'mermaids', 'rich', 'chinese', 'fur', 'coats', 'expensive', 'phones', 'tried', 'glance', 'screen', 'ui', 'mandarin', 'wasnt', 'single', 'nation', 'hadnt', 'sent', 'talented', 'children', 'theyd', 'walking', 'around', 'campus', 'proudly', 'wearing', 'mcgill', 'merch', 'bumping', 'along', 'mctavish', 'knowing', 'chance', 'making', 'time', 'class', 'within', 'ten', 'minutes', 'break', 'especially', 'cursed', 'class', 'mcintyre', 'xb', 'miss', 'walking', 'across', 'lower', 'campus', 'stressful', 'midterm', 'skyscrapers', 'staring', 'afar', 'lucky', 'enough', 'path', 'wasnt', 'construction', 'neither', 'rest', 'city', 'id', 'encounter', 'curious', 'tourists', 'taking', 'pictures', 'arts', 'building', 'id', 'leave', 'roddick', 'gates', 'beautifully', 'illuminated', 'red', 'xb', 'pity', 'years', 'entering', 'students', 'havent', 'tasted', 'alma', 'maters', 'actual', 'milk', 'offered', 'powdered', 'alternative', 'instead', 'doesnt', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'real', 'thing']",1,0,0,0

You complain that schools online and that you want an offline full experience, but your actions are just contradicting.

Im a TA for a course of 300 students and as if manually marking 300 coding assignments and 300 quiz submissions where students have hundreds of different variations for a simple program isnt enough, I need to read through and reply to 50 emails and discussion board complaints each day from angry students who want marks back for a question they clearly did wrong. Im perfectly happy to explain to a student what they got wrong on an assignment or quiz and equally happy to give back marks if they deserve it, but most students contact the TAs simply to vent and release their frustrations. Ive already lost count of how many disrespectful and aggressive emails Ive gotten, and it really hurts. Us TAs are only trying to do our jobs. They seem to think that we TAs have the power to decide the grading scheme, when really all we do is mark their assignments and quizzes according to the guidelines set out by the professor.

They dont seem to understand that we are also students and were also going through the same remote learning and life struggles that they have. Ive already been working overtime at this position and have been neglecting my own coursework and research for this job, and Im really overwhelmed.

How to deal with grief,"I lost my grandpa at the end of August right before school started. Due to the pandemic I couldnt go back home until August and my grandpa passed 4 days after I got home. My grandpa is literally my whole childhood and losing him is one of my worst fear. I was heartbroken and desperate. I spent the whole first week of school crying. Since school made me busier lately I didnt think about it that much and most of the time I was okay during the day. But once Im alone, all the thoughts and emotions Ive been trying to repress start to hurt and its truly overwhelming. Ive already spent countless nights crying myself to sleep these days and sometimes I wasnt even able to sleep the whole night. All I can do is just hopelessly watching the sky slowly turning bright. This is my first time losing someone whos real close to me and I feel like my grief is getting unhealthy and it just seems I can never get over it.

my frosh leader is partying literally outside my window...,"i started my frosh today and i just moved in a couple days ago into my new apartment in the ghetto. its ok so far and Ive been having a good time. however, for cultural and personal reasons, I do not drink. thats something Ive been really happy wth about an online frosh because I heard and saw on videos there is a lot of drinking and I didnt. want to feel pressured or uncool for drinking. but imagine by surprise I looked out my apartment window and my frosh leader and one of the organizers i saw in the intro video are literally playing beer pong right outside of my apartment.

i guess it isnt a big deal but Im feeling a little uncomfortable. especially because my frosh leaders assured us there was no drinking. it is only one of my leaders but still... i feel like theyre saying one thing and doing another!

what can I do? can switch frosh groups?

my friends are not respecting the quarantine act,"Might be an unpopular opinion on this sub but like im so mad rn lol

Have friends coming back to montreal from France and the USA and other parts of Europe and so on, and bro these people dont give a shit at all about the quarantine act.

I understand that the options are low when it comes to moving in, but I dont see any efforts to make an accommodation or get help from those around them.

if this is you, stop. please. Canada has flattened the curve better than the rest of the world  dont send us all back to quarantine and to the hospitals bc youre too selfish to care about the effects your actions may have on others, or because you didnt see the need to plan your move back accordingly.

by no means am I advocating that Canada closes its borders to every single person coming back. I myself have come back from the US and respected the 14 day quarantine bc i know that comparatively to the people in my state who are seeing hundreds of death per day, that its such a small price to pay.

"I know it isnt ideal, but does anyone feel like McGill is actually doing the right thing?","So I hate to play devils advocate, but I have been thinking about this a lot.

As a someone who lives in Montreal, if McGill were to open in the fall, we would risk transmission within our own community and within the entire downtown core of the city, including all the major transport areas and where most of the citys homeless population lives and sleeps.

It is normal to be super disappointed about losing certain university experiences and having classes done remotely, but as an entire community, we are potentially saving lives. LOTS of lives. How much more concrete positive social action could we get? If taking a class online could potentially spare someone from going to the ER room or losing a loved one, I am kinda all in.

We have no actually idea what the risk of transmission is or would be if we had people come back to campus. We have ideas and theories  but realistically, I dont think we actually know. Can you imagine what would happen if we did go on campus and a bunch of people got sick, or even potentially died? How would McGill look then?

Does anyone feel like we are losing sight of this?

I liked the 72 hour exams,"Hear me out. I enjoyed the 72 hour exam format more than normal exams. I think many of the issues with it stemmed from it being unplanned as well as students dealing with a pandemic. 

I think it was wrong for professors to steer away from the 3 hour time limit because of what people are going through as well as just the fact that it was promised. That being said, if we were told there was no limit and we knew we had to prepare for difficult three day exams and the world was functioning normally, I feel this method could work really well.

Keep in mind this is my experience for the exams I took which were biol 202 and math 223, so Im unsure how it worked literally any other course. For math 223 the exam had some really interesting questions that you couldnt just google. Personally I typically walk out of math exams not having retained anything as well as a bad mark. I havent gotten a mark back yet but I think the exam went well and I actually still remember a lot a week later. The exam really stressed me out but the reasons could easily be avoided in normal circumstances I.e. knowing the format from the syllabus, access to normal resources, no pandemic, and the professor having time to plan it properly. Even for biol 202s multiple choice I really had to learn stuff to complete it. 

Without the time limit I was able to learn the stuff I hadnt properly prepared for and then demonstrate it and feel challenged. A lot of the challenge I feel in normal exams is just the sheer stress of the situation as well as having to memorize or retain information. This post is getting long but I could go on and on with why I really dislike sit down exams.

Do Not Rent Thread 2020,"Hi all,

I assume Im not the only one worrying about where I am going to live next year.

Ill go first

DO NOT RENT FROM 1575 AVENUE SUMMERHILL

Yes, I know it is in a wonderful location. That is, in fact, the only redeeming quality of this building. Here is a list of all the crap my roommates and I have had to go through in the past 15 months

1 When we visited the complex in February 2019, we were not allowed to visit our specific unit because it was being renovated. Instead, all visitors were allowed to see the same showroom first red flag.  When we moved in, our unit looked quite different from the showroom and was halfway underground. 

2 Right after we moved in, there was loud construction in the unit directly above us starting at 630am like, not just the construction itself but also yelling and blasting rock music. We contacted our landlord multiple times about it. Each time she said she would talk to the constructions workers nevertheless the early morning noise continued. Also, random water shutoffs for 4 hours at a time which we get no notice for. Management denied these shutoffs were happening. 

2 A couple weeks after moving in, the construction workers cut one of the water lines in the unit above ours, causing our ceiling to flood, the fire alarm to go off, and raw sewage to leak from our ceiling, damaging some of our valuables. They compensated us with 20 Starbucks gift cards and said the damage wasnt serious enough for any more compensation. 

3 Since our unit was newly renovated, it was not recognized as an official address and STILL IS NOT to this day, technically. This created problems with getting wifi and HydroQuebec set up we actually still dont have a HydroQuebec account, even though we contacted them multiple times about it. 

4 There is absolutely no security at the front door, and the construction workers often prop the door which is usually locked open. Once as I was heading to class in the morning there was a homeless man sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. 

5 In early September, the company that owned the building University Apartments sold the building and there was a sudden change of management. Because the new company COGEIM did not have online banking set up at the time, we had to walk all the way to their office at 1450 Rene Levesque to pay rent IN CASH every month. They eventually set up online banking for 4 banks, of which my bank was not included.

6 After the change of management, we learned the person who had managed the emergency number for University Apartments was living in the Philippines. So if I were theoretically stuck in the elevator, I would be calling someone halfway across the world. lol

7 The cockroaches. Oh, the cockroaches. Thank God we didnt have bedbugs like some of the other units, but the cockroaches were everywhere. In the cabinets. In the bathtub. In my printer. INSIDE THE TABLE somehow. We had to have our apartment sprayed 4 times during the Fall, and each time required us taking literally everything out of every cabinet and setting it in the middle of the apartment. Not a fun time during midterms, especially when they gave us 24h notice.

8 The heating system is very outdated and doesnt work properly. Our apartment was always about 3C too warm. Other units had no heating at all, even when it was 18C out. There are older people living in our building. They could have died. 

9 The false fire alarms. There were 4 of them in one weekend once thankfully the weather wasnt too cold at this point. The fire department got pissed at COGEIM and told them they needed to fix the alarm system. So they did. The next morning. And didnt tell us that they would be coming in to our units to fix it. So we woke up one Tuesday morning at 9am hearing 2 men talking in our living room. My roommate went and talked to them, and they said it was an emergency and that they didnt need our permission to come in to fix our fire alarms. Then they laughed at us for still being asleep at 9am on a weekday. 

10 One of the sinks the construction workers used on the third floor became backed up, causing untreated water to flood parts of the third AND SECOND floors. It took multiple days of many people calling the emergency number for anyone to respond. 

11 Now the juiciest part the bathroom construction. Everyone in the building got a notice 6 days in advance we are legally supposed to get 10 days notice that construction workers would be coming into our bathrooms, tearing out the walls and ceiling and removing the vanities. This was because the renovations University Apartments had done were purely for aesthetic value and they had ignored that the plumbing needed to be replaced. The notice said this construction would last 78 business days. Well, the construction workers forced themselves into our unit 1 day before they were supposed to because they were ahead of schedule some other units they came in 4 days earlier than planned. Despite being ahead of schedule, we had no vanity, ceilings or walls in our bathroom for over a month. I could see the unit above me when I was in the shower. She could see me. It was awkward. The dustasbestos coming out of our bathroom walls gave everyone in my apartment breathing problems. In fact, EVERY UNIT in the building had a bathroom like this for over a month. Then the pandemic started and they ceased construction, leaving the bathrooms the way they were I was able to come back home to get away from all this mess thankfully, but I know a lot of people dont have that privilege and are still living in those conditions. 

12 Many people in the building decided to go on a rent strike for April, myself included. We filed multiple complaints with the Regie and sent COGEIM multiple warning emails before April 1st and received no response from management. We finally got an email yesterday which addressed my roommates and me by misspelled versions of our names from COGEIM reminding us that we havent paid our April rent and threatening us with going to the Regie if we dont pay. Well, looks like well see you in court, COGEIM. 

In short, avoid this building at all costs.",1587767799,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/g7i7yb/do_not_rent_thread_2020/,88,shrimpburrito,g7i7yb,4/24/2020 22:36,"['hi', 'assume', 'im',

McGills divestment is hopefully coming!,"They just sent out an email detailing the plan to divest McGill from carbonintensive investments such as fossil fuels, cement and steel producers, and coal and gas fired power plants and reinvest in renewable energy, clean investments, etc.

shoutout to the lovely profs out there,"with all the angerdisappointmentstresssadness going around with the online exam and assignment situation, i just wanted to give a big shoutout to the subset of profs who have done a GOOD job handling this whole crisis. whether theyre giving extension after extension, asking about students mental health, trying to adjust the grading scale as favorably for the class as possible, or simply just succeeded in adapting their assignments and assessments to the online format, i think they deserve a round of applause at the very minimum. this is a strange, scary time for them too, and i have to thank every prof that still gave a curve even tho the class average might be too high! or purposely made their exam easier.

were all struggling right now and i would love to hear more about profs that have gone above and beyond or even just the average ones haha! this was prompted by me getting a very good, very curved grade on the comp 251 final. i might not have enjoyed his class very much, but devroye set up a final that allowed anyone putting in minimal effort to do okay, and then still curved it. he also prerecorded lectures long before mcgill announced the switch to online and has been very responsive to everyones stressedout questions. as someone whose life has only been minimally disrupted by covid, i can only imagine how relieving it must have been for students in stickier situations.

MyCourses appreciation thread,"So, I was just watching a lecture and, as every normal human being, I was bored out of my mind, so I started looking around on the mycourses page at all the different buttons and links and then I went on the home page and I did something I never did before. I payed attention to all the little details and I have to say... for a school website mycourses is actually really beautiful. Its modern and well organized. The icons are cute and simple and the material design look is really well integrated imo. The text is easy to read and emphasis is put on what actually needs it and is not used randomly.  Also, the different course cover images are really pleasant to look at and makes finding your course super easy at a glance. 

Now compare this with the horrendous mymcgill page or the far too simplified minerva page and youll see the kind of website Im used to from highschool or cegep.

The SSMU constitutional referendum is invalid. It is about a document which does not exist.,"You may have noticed that the SSMU referendum includes a question about an amended constitution. In the document, it is written that only the French version of the constitution will be authoritative, unlike in the present version, where both French and English are taken to be equally authoritative.

But the document presented to us is only in English. So I asked for the French version, since that is the version which would have actual effect. And my response I received was

 Due to time constraints as a result of the situation were in, the communications team was unable to produce a French version of this document. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Further clarification from SSMU President Bryan Buraga indicated that the French version was not simply inaccessible to the communications team, but that it had not been written. According to him, the final revisions to the proposed new constitution were written twelve days ago, and there was not time to prepare a proper French translation.

Especially considering that the constitution shares much with the current version, and the revision process was continual, with many parts being already in place for months. But OK, fine. I can understand the desire to take the time with the translation, even though there are good translation companies who could do this job in 12 days. But I suppose this may be for the best. The current SSMU constitutions quality of French is absolutely awful. If you speak French at all, read it for yourselfhttpswww.docdroid.netlgR7kR8constitutionssmufrench20171110.pdf and weep. Its worse than the listservs. Its clear that nobody with even a cursory knowledge of French ever read half the sentences in this document before it was approved.

So, fine, we care about French now. We even will need a whole honking fee to not fuck up what really should be a basic task for us in a Frenchspeaking city, at a university with many native Frenchspeaking students. Fine, Im all for doing it right and getting, you know, the basics of French grammar down.

But what is NOT acceptable is not actually having the authoritative text of a constitution to present for the referendum. This isnt a bullshit little informal group. SSMU is an actual legal entity. Its time it started acting like one.

You CANNOT have a referendum without offering the actual authoritative text of the proposed constitution. That shit aint kosher. Come back when you have the actual document we are supposed to be voting on, or dont come back at all. Otherwise all of this is blatantly invalid.",1585074600,161,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/foaacw/the_ssmu_constitutional_referendum_is_invalid_it/,22,BeckoningVoice,foaacw,3/24/2020 18:30,"['may', 'noticed', 'ssmu', 'referendum', 'includes', 'question', 'amended', 'constitution.', 'document', 'written', 'french', 'version', 'constitution', 'authoritative', 'unlike', 'present', 'version', 'french', 'english', 'taken', 'equally', 'authoritative.', 'document', 'presented', 'us', 'english.', 'asked', 'french', 'version', 'since', 'version', 'would', 'actual', 'effect.', 'response', 'received', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'result', 'situation', 'communications', 'team', 'unable', 'produce', 'french', 'version', 'document.', 'apologize', 'inconvenience', 'may', 'cause.', 'clarification', 'ssmu', 'president', 'bryan', 'buraga', 'indicated', 'french', 'version', 'simply', 'inaccessible', 'communications', 'team', 'written.', 'according', 'final', 'revisions', 'proposed', 'new', 'constitution', 'written', 'twelve', 'days', 'ago', 'time', 'prepare', 'proper', 'french', 'translation.', 'especially', 'considering', 'constitution', 'shares', 'much', 'current', 'version', 'revision', 'process', 'continual', 'many', 'parts', 'already', 'place', 'months.', 'ok', 'fine.', 'understand', 'desire', 'take', 'time', 'translation', 'even', 'though', 'good', 'translation', 'companies', 'could', 'job', 'days.', 'suppose', 'may', 'best.', 'current', 'ssmu', 'constitutions', 'quality', 'french', 'absolutely', 'awful.', 'speak', 'french', 'read', 'weep.', 'worse', 'listservs.', 'clear', 'nobody', 'even', 'cursory', 'knowledge', 'french', 'ever', 'read', 'half', 'sentences', 'document', 'approved.', 'fine', 'care', 'french', 'now.', 'even', 'need', 'whole', 'honking', 'fee', 'fuck', 'really', 'basic', 'task', 'us', 'frenchspeaking', 'city', 'university', 'many', 'native', 'frenchspeaking', 'students.', 'fine', 'im', 'right', 'getting', 'know', 'basics', 'french', 'grammar', 'down.', 'acceptable', 'actually', 'authoritative', 'text', 'constitution', 'present', 'referendum.', 'isnt', 'bullshit', 'little', 'informal', 'group.', 'ssmu', 'actual', 'legal', 'entity.', 'time', 'started', 'acting', 'like', 'one.', 'cannot', 'referendum', 'without', 'offering', 'actual', 'authoritative', 'text', 'proposed', 'constitution.', 'shit', 'aint', 'kosher.', 'come', 'back', 'actual', 'document', 'supposed', 'voting', 'dont', 'come', 'back', 'all.', 'otherwise', 'blatantly', 'invalid.']",1,0,0,0

I also heard Asian restaurants that I used to visit quite often Ganadara, KimGalbi etc. have been attacked and robbed.  I cant help but wonder if all these incidences are happening as a result of frustrated and ignorant people venting out their angers towards Asian people regarding the whole Coronavirus related issues.

As a KoreanCanadian student, I personally never experienced blatant racism, but all of these events happening all at once during this time of fear and chaos seems to bring out the hidden xenophobic and racist tendencies of some people. Its truly sad to see ignorance, hatred and anger devour some people who end up engaging in these clearly racist assaults. Its not Asian people you have to fight, its the Coronavirus.

Much of the information below has been adapted from ubrianthelionns previous megathread.httpswww.reddit.comrmcgillcommentsfg29hdaddressingcovid19andmisinformation Many thanks for all of their hard work maintaining it!

Symptoms and treatment of COVID19

COVID19 is the respiratory infection caused by the novel new coronavirus which originated in December in Wuhan, China. It is part of a family of viruseshttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiCoronavirus that includes SARS and MERS.

The most common symptoms of COVID19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. If you feel sick, call 5146444545 for advice. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

Other possible symptoms include muscle aches, nasal congestion, a runny nose, a sore throat, or diarrhea. However, some cases are totally asymptomatic, while remaining contagious. Symptoms can develop up to 14 days from the date of infection, with an average incubation period of 5 to 6 days.

Information about the testing site at HtelDieu Hospital is available here.httpssantemontreal.qc.caenpubliccoronaviruscovid19c37517

Around 80 of cases are considered mild, and can generally be treated at home by resting, staying hydrated, and taking medication to reduce fever as needed. However, more severe cases may require hospitalization. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

Steps to take

The virus spreads through tiny droplets that travel through the air when we cough and sneeze. When these land on our hands or other shared surfaces like doorknobs and tables, others can pick up the virus. Accordingly, you should

 Wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.httpswww.canada.cacontentdamphacaspcdocumentsservicesdiseasesmaladiesreducespreadcovid19washyourhandsenghandwashing.pdf Hand sanitizer should only be used in the absence of soap.

 Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow, and when you use a tissue, immediately dispose of it and wash your hands.

 Dont touch your face with unwashed hands! This is the number one way to become infected. Disinfect your phone screen, laptop keyboard, and any other surfaces you frequently use.

 Practice social distancing by remaining at home. When you do make essential trips outside, stay at least 2 metres 6 feet away from others.

 Leave masks for those who need them sick or immunocompromised people, and those who spend time around them, such as health workers. A mask provides little protection if youre just walking around outside, and chances are you wouldnt be wearing it correctly.httpswww.reddit.comrmcgillcommentsfhp232megathreadnovelcoronaviruscovid19pandemicallfknrtnc

 Make contingency plans with your family, roommates, friends, andor neighbours, such as to go shopping for one another if someone is required to quarantine.

How serious is this?

This is a serious situation and significantly worse than the seasonal flu. The viruss overall mortality rate is unknown because many cases are not tested and confirmed, but it the WHO estimates it to be about 2.53.5. This rate also increases if the healthcare system becomes so overwhelmed that some cases cannot be treated.

In general, the global situation has become more severe over the past month. Again, the world is not coming to an end, but its important to pay attention to the situation and follow the guidelines in place. Weve seen what has been happening in countries that were highly proactive like South Korea vs. countries that were less so like the United States.

Just because you may be young and healthy, you arent in the clear. While most deaths have been among older people and those with existing health problems such as a compromised immune system, some younger people have also become badly ill, and regardless, you do not want to spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.

Cat called Posting again because mod deleted,"I was walking on Sherbrooke the other day, and this tall, thin boy walks next to me and starts talking to me about the weather. At first I just respond like any half decent person would do. Since Im walking towards class in Wilson he keeps on talking to me he kept on hitting on me, calling me the most beautiful woman I had ever met and asked what he had to do to get my number. This made me feel uncomfortable and I then told him explicitly that I did not appreciate being cat called in the MIDDLE OF CAMPUS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY! He eventually followed me all the way to class and eventually left. When I spoke to one of my friends, she showed me a profile of someone who was him, and then told me all the stories of how this person was a creep to other girls too, and the previous reddit post about him. What can I do about this person I saw on the previous reddit post that he followed a first year girl home, but Im literally in my 4th year, and this guy still tries to hit on me. I called him out for it but thats because Ive had experiences of dealing with this, but for someone who hasnt, the first time can be daunting. Is there actually anyone in particular I can go to to talk about this? No girl deserves to go through what I experienced on their way to class.

To all McGillians from China,"Tbh these days I just dont have the passion for studying. My life has been in a passive circle ever since the coronavirus outbreak happened in China half a month ago. The very first thing I see every morning is the notification of new deaths happened over night. MY whole family lives in the very center of  Chongqing, a city among top five of the cities with the most ppl infected. Now the holiday is almost over and my parents have to go to work in very few days but they still havent been able to buy enough face masks for themselves and my younger brother studying in a local boarding school. I just cant stop worrying all of my families and friends all the time. Its not only me, but also almost every Chinese I know, including my roommate from Guangdong, who hasnt been sleeping in a few days. However, I dont think McGill is fully aware of what Chinese McGillians are going through. McGill is already pretty stressful, and all these pressure and worries just make it worse. So here Im calling to ask for McGill university to provide additional emotional support opening to all students who think they have been affected by coronavirus outbreak. Anyone who thinks additional emotional support is a necessary measure can just like or leave a comment under this post to show your support. Moreover, I do hope everyone who sees this post and their families and friends can make through this hard period. I do understand the first month is this new decade has been tough, but as long as we stick together it will end up just fine.

SU Loophole?,"You know how SU is only allowed for courses not required for your major?
What if you accidentally

1. Be in a major you dont intend to be in for a term
2. Take a course required for your desired major as SU
3. Get an S
4. Switch to your desired major after the term or year is over
5. Pretend like nothing happened as long as you dont break any other SU rules and you have enough graded credits to graduate

What are they going to do? Not let you graduate with your desired major because those credits werent graded? UnSU that course? Hunt down the prof for that course and ask them to calculate a students grade who took the course a year or two ago? Make you retake it even though you didnt fail?

Is it possible to abuse the SU system like this?
Take that big Suze.

"The discussion of race, colonialism and imperialism in Arts courses.","I have no problem acknowledging the extensive damages that colonialism has inflicted on societies all over the world. I do feel like, however, as someone currently studying in international development, that we talk about it a little too much. I am currently in my second semester, and every single one of my classes related to IDS have dedicated a substantial amount of their curriculum to provide a detailed examination of the negative consequences of western imperialism. I just spent two whole years in CEGEP listening to my prof talk about the negative impacts of colonialism, and here at McGill we are still talking about it, which wouldnt even be a bad thing if we werent talking about it in the exact same way, in every single class. I understand that it is important to learn about the background and history of the world, but I feel like this is a bit much. 

I also feel like discussion can often be onesided during class and conferences. Take white privilege, for example, which is a subject that often comes up in polisci and anthropology conferences. Now, I absolutely understand how our society, and many others, might grant certain ethnic or racial groups substantial advantages in everyday life. I also think, however, that there exist many counterarguments to this point of view. A person that harbours the view that, in fact, white privilege isnt as prevalent as we think in western society may very well possess pertinent ideas that are worth sharing. Even if those ideas are not pertinent, I feel like it would be entertaining to hear about them. 

I have never heard, ever, someone share a controversial idea in any of my conferences so far. So much for debate. So much for being exposed to ideas you dislike, so much for discussion. I really feel like this is a shame. One of my profs this semester has gone the furthest I have seen any prof go by stating that colonialism, did, in fact, have SOME positive impacts. He proceeded to not elaborate on these impacts at all. But I want to know! Im curious! What are these impacts?? Let me learn something new goddamit.

What the fuck just happened to me on Parc,"I was picking up some groceries and just on my way home from provigo on Parc, I was walking down towards Sherbrooke and there was an old lady with a little cart walking towards me.

Problems with the antiBill 21 activism,"Hi, I apologize if this isnt allowed or if I offend anyone. This is just me venting because some stuff has been on my mind about the activism against Bill 21 at McGill, and how I think it is failing the people most affected by the issue.

The direct reason Im making this post is because this morning at 10, I had a class in the Education building. If you were there today, you would know some students were picketing outside over Bill 21. As someone not in Education, and especially as a visibly Muslim woman, I assumed that I wouldnt have a problem and walked up to the door.

However, when I tried to enter, a white man physically accosted me and got in my face about how I was crossing their picket line. I tried to move past, but he kept blocking my path until finally I had to sort of push my way through.

This incident left me feeling decidedly violated and shaken. It reminded me of the other times I have felt unsafe in white maledominated activist spaces at McGill. Just to be clear, I am fully against Bill 21, and this is only my isolated personal experience, but it made me notice some other problems as well.

For example, SSMU advertised a Bill 21 protest today for noon, but of course this is at the same time many observant Muslims need to attend Friday Jumuah prayers. And I have also heard from a couple of my Jewish friends that they are unhappy with the AUS holding their antiBill 21 general assembly at 430, right when folks have to get ready for Shabbat.

I am glad that people want to be allies to their religious and racialised friends. But to me, it seems that those most affected by the bill are not being prioritized, which is the opposite of what should be happening.

Thank you for reading.

opinion people think its hard to make friends at mcgill because theyve never had to try before,"Title is weird but I didnt really know how to say it concisely.

Theres been some back and forth about how people struggle making friends at McGill on the sub, and a lot of the discussion ends up boiling down to points like the classes are too big or you have to put yourself out there etc. Ive been thinking about this question a lot recently, as Im about to graduate and Ive made far fewer friends than I would have liked during my time here. I accept that a lot of that is on me, and I accept its pretty much too late to do much about it now, but as someone with a lot of friends in high school, I didnt expect the difficulties I had.

I think, for many people, the problem with making friends at university comes from the fact that this is an environment weve never had to make friends in before. By that I mean, the vast majority of my friends I made during my time in high school were in my classes, on the same buses, and on the same teams as me. I feel this is probably true of a lot of people.

For the first 18 years of life, our pool of friends at school was 30200 people large give or take, from your first class to your graduating year in high school. In an environment like that, youre bound to come in contact with the same people a lot, and while that doesnt guarantee youll make friends, its a hell of a lot easier.

The people on this sub who talk about how they were decent at making friends usually cite the same things clubs, teams, organizations, rez, but not class for the most part. I argue that most people coming in to first year never had to find an extracurricular just to find someone to consistently talk to. Schoolclass itself is no longer the place to find friends.

The purpose of this post isnt to blame McGill or anything. Classes are the size that they are and thats probably not going to change, and I cant change the choices Ive made over the years. I just wanted to put my thoughts out there, mostly to figure out of this resonates with anyone else or not.

To everyone whos having a hard time,"So, this is going to be sappy, get ready. When I first started at McGill, fresh from cgep, I got my ass kicked. In my first year, I got a C in two courses, failed one course with a D and had a cumulative GPA of 2.9. I was convinced I wasnt smart, that everything was going to shit and I was just not meant to thrive in my major. I applied to every lab imaginable, was told my grades were weak and so I had a hard time building my CV. I was let go from a lab because I wasnt the right fit  I was certain I was a failure.

As time went by, I got to take courses more relevant to my interests, acquire experience in research better suited to what I want to do and the result I got from that today is incredible. After so many tears and anguish over my time at McGill, I got a 4.0 term GPA this semester and I couldnt be prouder of how far I have gone. I kept pushing, trusting my gut that this is where I belong and I finally feel like all my work paid off. Had someone told me I would get a 4.0 in my first year I would have laughed at their face and said it was impossible. If you just got hit by a hard class, or just finding McGill challenging, it doesnt reflect on who you  are. You are not your failures. First year is just difficult. GPAs can rise. You can learn.

Is it just me or grads and undergrads really disconnected?,"Why are grads and undergrads so disconnected? Why do I need to be a TA to be connected with undergrads?

The thing is, grads have a lot to offer in terms of experience to the undergrad, an experience which does not have to be confined to the lab, and vice versa. I have personally learned a lot since I joined my masters program. Report writing, expectations, stress management, deliverables, work quality, and so many things other things that are not necessarily technical in nature, but are just important traits to have.

It could be a very casual relationship, where the undergrad and grad complain to each other about problems, potentially offer solutions, or maybe just listen. I am not saying strictly technical problems and homework. It could be anything. It can also help the undergrad get a glimpse on gradlife. In turn, the grad student would feel fulfilled to have talked to someone outside their extremely small circle.

I am already familiar with the buddy program, but the buddy program is limited to starters, and really just connects grads with grads. I am looking for something more general.

"PSA your GPA means NOTHING unless youre going into Med, Law, Ivy Grad","Im done my undergrad now and unfortunately just learned that my grades mean beans.   Employers care way more about your experiences in internships, jobs, projects and extracurriculars. Also NETWORKING!

Even for grad school, a low grade doesnt mean end all. As long as youre talking to your profs, making connections, taking a part of projectsresearch. You might just get back into McGill! 

I wish I spent more time doing participation stuff but spent most of my degree stressing a lot over grades.

I have friends with average gpas get into great jobs by simple networking. Or luck

I have friends with amazing GPA MCAT score but didnt get into Med we think its from lack of stellar references

I have friends who had lower than a 3 in GPA get into the Big 4 firms. 

I have friends who had average good GPAs not make it in their grad program but just switched to Law and killed their LSAT

That being said, OK, dont fail your classes lol. But one fail is not the end of all. Neither is two. As long as you can pick yourself back up.

Had a horrible experience at the Wellness Hub today,"I was recently diagnosed with insomnia by my therapist, and she wants me to do a sleep study. I need a referral for a sleep specialist. I go to the Wellness Hub today to make an appointment for January because its not urgent, but they give me one today within the hour. I see the doctor, tell her my spiel, and she chastises me for coming to see a doctor because this is a dropin appointment and that is not what dropin appointments are for, and I should have made a future appointment instead. I told her the front desk told me I could have this appointment for this purpose and she says yeah they always say that. Then she questions if Im really depressed and how depressed and if I really need therapy. She takes my blood pressure, I leave without a referral and with a newfound hatred for the Wellness Hub.

A perspective on the McGill bodySSMU and BDS,"In light of the general sentiment on campus towards Israel this articlehttpswww.nytimes.com20191114opinioncollegeisraelantisemitism.html gives a perspective that I imagine would be very relevant for many Jews on campus. Especially with regard to the recent post addressing the invitation of various student group executives to visit Israel.  A couple of selected sections to get the gist of the article if you dont feel like reading the whole thing

Before I arrived on campus, I could proudly say that I was both a strong progressive and a Zionist. I didnt think there was a conflict between those two ideas. In fact, I understood them as being in sync, given that progressives have long championed the liberation movements of downtrodden minorities. I viewed  and still view  the establishment of the state of Israel as a fundamentally just cause the most persecuted people in human history finally gaining the right of selfdetermination after centuries of displacement, intimidation, violence and genocide. For me, this remains true even as I oppose the occupation of the West Bank. It is my Zionism that informs my view that the Palestinian people also have the right to their own state.   
  
 On college campuses and in progressive circles across the country, it does not matter if you strongly oppose the rightwing leadership in Israel if you are a Zionist, you are seen as the enemy. It does not matter if you think President Trump is a monster for smearing Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib I have been branded irredeemably problematic on G.W.s campus because of my unwillingness to unconditionally support their politics. It does not matter if you believe in the right of self determination for all people, including Palestinians if you still feel a connection to the State of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, you are on the wrong side of history. 

Jews have traditionally been a liberal demographic in Western countries but the widespread demonization of Zionism could very well turn that around. In a time where blind populism is causing crazy outcomes from the right Trump, there should also be some attention paid to similar blindness coming from the left. The politicians on both sides benefit from divisive conflict as it draws attention and fires people up, but what would really be best for both the Israelis and Palestinians is conflict resolution. By alienating all Zionists and taking a hardline stance on the left, people create just as much of a barrier to peace as people on the right. Just some food for thought for when situations like the Igor Sadikov punch a Zionist post from last year pop up and people excuse that call for violence, disregarding the fact that allowing it will only cause further division and make your own side appear as bad as you view the other.",1573769957,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/dwgw9p/a_perspective_on_the_mcgill_bodyssmu_and_bds/,2,SSMfU,dwgw9p,11/14/2019 22:19,"['light', 'general', 'sentiment', 'campus', 'towards', 'israel', 'article', 'gives', 'perspective', 'imagine', 'would', 'relevant', 'many', 'jews', 'campus.', 'especially', 'regard', 'recent', 'post', 'addressing', 'invitation', 'various', 'student', 'group', 'executives', 'visit', 'israel.', 'couple', 'selected', 'sections', 'get', 'gist', 'article', 'dont', 'feel', 'like', 'reading', 'whole', 'thing', 'arrived', 'campus', 'could', 'proudly', 'say', 'strong', 'progressive', 'zionist.', 'didnt', 'think', 'conflict', 'two', 'ideas.', 'fact', 'understood', 'sync', 'given', 'progressives', 'long', 'championed', 'liberation', 'movements', 'downtrodden', 'minorities.', 'viewed', 'still', 'view', 'establishment', 'state', 'israel', 'fundamentally', 'cause', 'persecuted', 'people', 'human', 'history', 'finally', 'gaining', 'right', 'selfdetermination', 'centuries', 'displacement', 'intimidation', 'violence', 'genocide.', 'remains', 'true', 'even', 'oppose', 'occupation', 'west', 'bank.', 'zionism', 'informs', 'view', 'palestinian', 'people', 'also', 'right', 'state.', 'college', 'campuses', 'progressive', 'circles', 'across', 'country', 'matter', 'strongly', 'oppose', 'rightwing', 'leadership', 'israel', 'zionist', 'seen', 'enemy.', 'matter', 'think', 'president', 'trump', 'monster', 'smearing', 'ilhan', 'omar', 'rashida', 'tlaib', 'branded', 'irredeemably', 'problematic', 'g.w.s', 'campus', 'unwillingness', 'unconditionally', 'support', 'politics.', 'matter', 'believe', 'right', 'self', 'determination', 'people', 'including', 'palestinians', 'still', 'feel', 'connection', 'state', 'israel', 'homeland', 'jewish', 'people', 'wrong', 'side', 'history.', 'jews', 'traditionally', 'liberal', 'demographic', 'western', 'countries', 'widespread', 'demonization', 'zionism', 'could', 'well', 'turn', 'around.', 'time', 'blind', 'populism', 'causing', 'crazy', 'outcomes', 'right', 'trump', 'also', 'attention', 'paid', 'similar', 'blindness', 'coming', 'left.', 'politicians', 'sides', 'benefit', 'divisive', 'conflict', 'draws', 'attention', 'fires', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'best', 'israelis', 'palestinians', 'conflict', 'resolution.', 'alienating', 'zionists', 'taking', 'hardline', 'stance', 'left', 'people', 'create', 'much', 'barrier', 'peace', 'people', 'right.', 'food', 'thought', 'situations', 'like', 'igor', 'sadikov', 'punch', 'zionist', 'post', 'last', 'year', 'pop', 'people', 'excuse', 'call', 'violence', 'disregarding', 'fact', 'allowing', 'cause', 'division', 'make', 'side', 'appear', 'bad', 'view', 'other.']",1,0,0,0

Trying to be Good,"Yesterday I had a pretty wild experience that I thought was worth sharing here. I pass the same few groups of homeless people when walking up Parc each day. As with any group of people, some are nicer than others, however, I personally believe that all people deserve basic rights regardless of how kind they are.

As Ive done a couple times before, I brought one of the guys, Bobby, inside Provigo with me to buy some food for him and his friends. Bobby in particular has always struck a note with me because he is always happy to share what he has with the others around him. His favorite meal is the Hungry Man 5 microwave meal. Theres a different brand on the shelf above it that is instead 25. Twice now, Bobby has chosen to get two of those and give one to his friend rather than the slightly larger meal for himself. Its the kind of thing that makes you admire someone despite their unfortunate circumstances.

Bobby and I bought 4 meals and a 2liter bottle of pepsi for he and his friends to share. We used the microwave inside Provigo to cook the meals, something Bobby is proud to know how to do well, and as he started the next meal, I would bring the cooked ones out to his friends. While waiting, I got to talk to Bobby more than usual, and I really felt for him and his friends, just trying to get by after being forced out of their homes for one reason or another.

Now for the important parts. As I was bringing out the second meal, a passing group of homeless people stopped to talk to the group I was helping, and two of the guys ended up getting into a pretty serious fight. I simply backed up, waited for it to pass, and made sure everyone not already fighting knew that Id give them food as soon as the fight was over.

While this was happening, a guy who was leaving Provigo stopped near me, asking if we should call the police. I said no, because I knew what that would mean for these people. Although I also had my phone in hand just in case, I was fairly sure it would blow over quickly, which it did the groups try to police themselves, and after that I gave them the food and explained to this guy what I was doing and why I didnt call the police. He ended up shaking my hand, and I believe his name was Jared or something similar. Jared, if youre reading this, thank you for being a good human. You told me you thought I was a good person, and that you admired what I was doing, but I want to also thank you for understanding. Not everyone has the means, time, or ability to help people like I did last night, so thats not what makes me a good person, but your instinct to help even when you didnt already know what was going on stood out to me as something for you to be proud of.

On the opposite end, after all four meals were finished cooking, I needed to leave while Bobby was still eating inside. I said goodbye, and let the workers at Provigo know what was happening they also recognize Bobby, so I told them he was simply finishing his meal and would leave after if he didnt they could just gently remind him to, because he was a bit drunk and might lose focus. The manager and the cashiers simply nodded and understood. However, the security guard, who knows me at this point, stopped me to tell me that although from a human side he understood what I was doing, next time, bring everything outside for them and dont bring them into the store, because sils voient un Inuktitut dans le magasin, ils vont tous venir. if they see an Inuktitut man in the store, theyll all come in. The way in which he told me this was clearly derogatory, and it really ate at me for the last day.

I understand that these people sometimes cause problems in stores. I fully realize that the reason stores follow them around and sometimes kick them out is because they do steal and they do break the rules. Whenever that is happening, I take no issue with it. But Bobby was a customer at this point he had taken the receipt after I paid, knew to keep it on him. When I walked in, I even motioned to the guard to tell him that Bobby was with me. And inside the store, I saw multiple instances of Bobby, drunk and homeless, being a kinder, more polite customer than some other people Ive seen. While waiting for his food, he picked up all the garbage on the floor in the eating area. He used the hand sanitizer by the microwave so that he wouldnt get my hands dirty when he handed me a marker to help him make a sign. He couldnt stop talking about his jacket, which a man had given to him that day when he had none, because Bobby had given his to one of his friends who was cold.

Im not trying to start a debate about what these people do or dont deserve I wont even be back on this account unless a public comment gives me reason to come back and check my PMs. Id just like to bring attention to how we talk about and treat the homeless community around here. Above all, they are people before anything else. I see lots of students donate or vocally support causes that help the homeless, but until we can stop looking at them as other and start remembering that they are people, simply disenfranchised and in unfortunate circumstances, we cannot truly help them better their lives.

TLDR I helped a group of homeless people by buying them food, and while some people were supportive, others warned me against doing what I had done. Id just like to remind everyone that they are people too, and they deserve the same basic rights as everyone else regardless of their circumstances.",1571169338,247,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/dideda/trying_to_be_good/,17,goodpersonthrowaway,dideda,10/15/2019 19:55,"['yesterday', 'pretty', 'wild', 'experience',

A Heartfelt ThankYou,"I have lost two friends to suicide in the last 6 months, with my second friend passing away two weeks ago. I just moved here from Alberta so I missed his funeral last week, the day after he would have turned 27. It hit me really hard and I was bawling outside of Old Chancellor Day Hall when this really kind blonde girl, who had seen me from inside, came up and asked if I was okay. She was super empathetic and it helped just telling someone what was going on instead of crying alone on a rock.

I was too upset to take her up on her offer of exchanging numbers but her compassion helped me pull myself together enough to get through the day. If Emma from Education reads this, I just wanted to say thank you so much for checking in on another girl who was clearly having a rough day. It made me really appreciate the McGill community and not feel so far away from home.

Twas the Night Before the First Day,"Twas the night before the first day, when all through the city  
All the students were anxious, while alumni looked on with pity.  
First years revised schedules with utmost care,  
While upper years dreamt of OAP, knowing midterms were already near.

Most students were snug watching Netflix in their beds,  
While those old enough to remember had visions of flood girl in their heads  
And profs with their backpacks, and TAs with their notes,  
Had finished planning how to hoard students onto the same sinking boats.

When out from the ghetto arose an uproar,  
Of course it was engineering students not realizing frosh was over.  
Away from the windows new tenants flew,   
Some were asking, Dont they know tomorrow is school?

Milton B  a ghost town, the Plateau all hush,  
In McGill Rezes all over, hopeful first years still talking about Frosh,  
Not realizing in due time that none of it would matter,  
Because some courses would give them a pounding, not unlike a stressed basic white girl beating cookie batter.

New methods of destressing they would soon discover and see  
By eating copious amounts of samosas dripping with chutney.  
In mose we trust, soon adopted as their unofficial motto,  
In search for their next fix from McMed to Maas, Otto.

They would learn to laugh at pages like Spotted or Overheard at McGill.  
When trying to find for their homework, the motivation or will.  
And although most of the posts on these pages would be bores,  
Some would be Pulitzer worthy, like the one of the couples having sex in the bathrooms on Schulichs 3rd and 6th floors.

Where is Macdonald Harrington?, Where is Macdonald Engineering?  
Where is the bus Macdonald Campus?, Pardon? I walked by OAP and lost my hearing.  
With questions met with kind answers, theyd stop feeling a little sad,  
Naively they would begin thinking, Oh this place isnt that bad.

Thats when theyll learn of McGill lifestyle, somethings with no reason,  
Like how construction is not an activity, but rather, an entire season.  
How it infested good ol Gerts, SSMUs pride and joy  
No more sketchy activities in the corner, or drunk weirdos yelling, Boi!  
Theyll learn of our ruler, the all powerful Big Suze,  
And about the pub in the McConnell basement, affectionately called Blues.  
Of recorded lectures and the ability to watch playbacks at x2 speed,  
And of the 120 pages each for three separate courses they have to read.  


Of BDA lines so long that make you contemplate life choices,  
Of trying to study in a quiet place, while disrespectful groups giggle with loud voices.  
Theyll learn of tales from McGills years past,   
Like how students held a vigil for a dead gorilla, and the words, hygiene de vie came to last.

How SSMU elections arent filled with drama every year,  
We collectively decided to spice it up because we knew you were coming here.  
Just kidding. Tts always been like this  SSMU election ABCs  
Although, most students still want to turn the Brown Building into a ChuckECheese. 

Finally, theyll hear myths by which most students swear,  
Like how if you graduate with a 4.0, you turn into a campus squirrel.  
In full instructor fashion, it seems that I digress,  
Back to this night, all aboard the soon to be Polar Express.

This poem is as dysfunctional as a McGill Printer,  
Oh look its September, in no time October and soon it will be Winter.   
On with it then, before I lose my motivation to write.  
Lets return to the present, back to this night.

Oh come on! one grad student cried while crushing a redbull,  
An email from the professor already giving out homework with the day that it was due.  
Regretting their decision to pursue more school,  
This solitary grad student started feeling a fool.

Some brave souls from all years still in full denial,  
Browsing alcohol in convenient stores up and down the aisle,  
With each whiff of tequila making them cringe,  
Thinking about the coming semester and which Netflix series to binge.

Eventually, some settled on Friends for the nth time,   
While others chose the Office and Brooklyn 99.  
Some roommates thought none of these selections were even remotely funny,  
In a bid to seem like they were knowledgeable they said, Try In Philadelphia, Its Always Sunny. 

After hours and hours, the night got late,  
All the froshies who proclaimed, I can handle my booze, finally discovered they were lightweight.  
Through Facebook, through Twitter and Insta some swiped,  
While Tinder and Bumble gave others the sweet taste of booty tonight. 

In all seriousness, though, I hope you enjoy these last few hours,  
Before McGill exerts on us all, its soul crushing powers.  
To freshmen, freshwomen and freshnonbinary students all the same,  
Us seasoned veterans wish you luck, even if we think youre kind of lame.

And remember, that if you ever need to cry.  
A remedy could be hiding behind the next, Bonjour, Hi.   
Work hard and play harder, that really is the best way  
To keep some semblance of your sanity at the end of each coming day.

Might we also offer you all some friendly good advice,  
Were all going through the same hell here so please be considerate and nice.  
If you follow this guidance and possibly your heart, youll all be alright,  
Happy new semester to all and to all a good night!",1567481648,243,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/cyzi37/twas_the_night_before_the_first_day/,19,OtioseTraveller,cyzi37,9/3/2019

MCGILL IN COURSE FINANCIAL AID,"Hi! I am a returning international student. Last year I had to pay over 60 000 CAD to mcgill for my tuition fees residency. This year is different for my parents and they cant afford to pay again 45 000 CAD for my tuition fees and theres the rent to include too. I applied for a incourse financial aid and I have an appointment with them. I was wondering how generous are they? I am actually not asking mcgill to give me out money to pay my rent and my expenses but is it possible that they could just wipe out my tuition fees for the year? I am not eligible to receive a government aid, and yet if I were Id be receiving like 1 000 CAD for the entire year. I did specify the circumstances in my application and I did my best to show them that it is an emergency.

SSMU VP Internal owes us an explanation!,"The mass email we all received from the VP Internal was completely uncalled for. They clearly have not done their research on the issue. On which basis is she calling it xenophobic nature? Does she not know how multiple countries in the middle east have suffered by bringing religion into government? Iran, Turkey

They may disagree with it, and I understand the reason why she might but that doesnt mean everyone does. For her to go out there and send us an email of her point of view is COMPLETELY, 100 wrong.

Iirc, she almost joked about our 10,000 being wasted last year because of some Halloween cover up that SSMU couldnt even do correctly.

As someone pointed out, today she may be emailing us on her views on a specific bill, but tomorrow shell be emailing everyone endorsing candidates for the Canadian election. She can not use her position to try and impose her point of view on us.

Its a real shame that she was very active during the election, posting AMAs and facebook ads, but its been over 24 hours and she has not even addressed a single one of our concerns.

A democracy is based on moral authority in my view, she has completely lost that authority to lead the students that she has so strongly offended and hurt by calling an issue so close to our hearts as xenophobic.

A short rant about the external transfer process.,"I dont understand the logic behind admitting students. As a transfer, we have to give them our first year grades and on top of that we have to give them our entire high school transcript. So they weigh our grade 7030 uni to highschool based on service point. According to the dean or whoever I emailed, she said they do this because one year of university is not enough evidence of work. Which is weird because according to that logic how are they admitting these grade 12s which are admitted based on simply their first term grades, at least my brother did even though he did badly in grade 11...

"Just graduated from McGill engineering, here are 3 tips I would like to share","Disclaimer  graduated from ecse , I dont know if those tips will apply to all faculties . Those are based on my own personal experience and might or might not apply to you.

1Attendance is absolutely useless in about 75 of classes  there will be classes where the prof is genuinely good at teaching or classes where prof doesnt put material on mycourses. But in general studying on your own is much more efficient. During my first few semesters I had a missing out feeling when not going to class. I was all in my head and it took me years to understand that.

2 Most profs recycle questions from past finals. Given limited amount of time, it is best to practice past finals on docuum than to do whatever tutorial or book exercises suggested.

3 Making contact with other students is absolutely key to academic success. In engineering you will be encountering some relatively hard assignments and projects. And even though profs say that the work must be done individually most people will be working with their friends and so should you.",1556994030,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/bko2i4/just_graduated_from_mcgill_engineering_here_are_3/,22,outplay-nation,bko2i4,5/4/2019 18:20,"['disclaimer', 'graduated', 'ecse', 'dont', 'know', 'tips', 'apply', 'faculties', '.', 'based', 'personal', 'experience', 'might', 'might', 'apply', 'you.', 'attendance', 'absolutely', 'useless', 'classes', 'classes', 'prof', 'genuinely', 'good', 'teaching', 'classes', 'prof', 'doesnt', 'put', 'material', 'mycourses.', 'general', 'studying', 'much', 'efficient.', 'first', 'semesters', 'missing', 'feeling', 'going', 'class.', 'head', 'took', 'years', 'understand', 'that.', 'profs', 'recycle', 'questions', 'past', 'finals.', 'given', 'limited', 'amount', 'time', 'best', 'practice', 'past', 'finals', 'docuum', 'whatever', 'tutorial', 'book', 'exercises', 'suggested.', 'making', 'contact', 'students', 'absolutely', 'key', 'academic', 'success.', 'engineering', 'encountering', 'relatively', 'hard', 'assignments', 'projects.', 'even', 'though', 'profs', 'say', 'work', 'must', 'done', 'individually', 'people', 'working', 'friends', 'you.']",1,0,1,0

Things I have learnt as an exchange student at McGill,"Ive been on exchange here for a year, and before I leave for warmer and hopefully greener pastures I thought that Id share a few things that have occurred to me while Ive been procrastinating.

MUAR classes are worthless FRSL classes are terrible Amlie QuesnelValle is the kindest prof I have ever had take one of her courses Daniel Cere is definitely in love with Charles Taylor using intuition does NOT work for the short answer part of the Comp 202 final Charles Boberg is obsessed with keeping grade averages the same year after year and linguistics is fun. 

Even though the university does about nothing at all to integrate exchange students, and even though neither ISS nor Service Point know what they are doing, and even though making friends here is really difficult, I have ever so slowly come to selfidentify as a McGill student. It gets to you, somehow. Had I been a fulltime student here I think I would have really enjoyed it.

I have taken classes in many different departments, at many different levels, and you McGill people are pretty cool. Most of the students I have talked to seem genuinely interested in their subjects and they come to class to try to actually learn something. Its nice to see.

You guys are way too stressed out though. Help each other. Share notes. Talk.

Also while I admire the effort behind Spotted McGill University, the meme game here is simply not befitting an institution of this size and stature. The recent formatrecycling Concordiabashing memes are some of the weakest I have ever seen. You can do better.

My unsent letter to fellow McGillians,"So I am graduating  4 years, I guess last week, last exam, this is it. Since I am no valedictorian, I figure this is a place that is as good as any to say some of my thoughts that I have never had the chance to say out loud.

To my professors,

Gosh, some of you sucked. Some of you only cared about your research, so you show up with downloadfrominternet5minago slides, and dont even know what is on your own assignments. Some of you mocked undergrads like us, think we are stupid, and I clearly recall one of you hinting that I am simply not cutout for this subject and quite frankly, its at those moments I felt like giving up.

However, during every such moment, there always seems to one of you that handed me the help and the hope I needed. I remember being embarrassed having tears dripping down on my paper as I couldnt understand your lectures. So you pretend you didnt see it while continue to explain the concept for the 4th time. You also made sure to tell me I was doing a good job simply by trying before I leave. Another one of you taught me how to spot and forgive my own mistakes, both as a scientist and as a person.  You gave me guidance on career and on life. You were composed and wise. As a person who is hottempered and emotional, a good number of you taught me how to distance myself, think clearly and objectively. Some of your words are the same words that I will ponder upon perhaps for a better half of my lifetime.

To My Fellow Classmen

You are without a doubt some of the most daring and ambitious people I have ever seen. Dont get me wrong, some of you are indeed arrogate, with an inflated sense of grandiose, and quite frankly not a nice person. But among you, I have also seen courage like I have never seen before. You influenced me to dream for a higher height, to be relentless, to have perseverance when it seems like that the pressure is too high, and the chances are too small. I came to McGill expecting a stepping stone to secure jobs a normal life, I go home disappointed. Little by little, you show me that despite its complicated existence, the world indeed has a place for dreams and passions, and for those who truly cares about thinking. I walk away holding those thoughts, your thoughts, about truth and life dear to my heart, and I hope to God, that I dont forget them along my way.

To my physics, computer science, stats, linear algebra TAs

You dont get paid enough for you do, thank you. You are nothing like some of the arrogant douchy guys I would meet in class. You are patient, kind, funny in some cases p and cared about teaching me the tools to think. Unlike some people including some of my classmates, you didnt treat me as a girl in hard sciences, you treated me as just a scientistresearcher even though I am yet far from it. We discuss theorems and corollaries for hours without realizing the time, until the security kick us out of the classroom. You respond to emails at midnights, make an effort to make time for me during your lunch hours. You taught me more than the professors ever did. I remember each one of your names, and I am so glad that some of us have become friends. And I am so happy that things are working out well for you guys, some of you have new jobs, got married, some are going to postdoc at amazing places, you have my deepest respect and I wish you all the best.

To my best friends who happens to not understand a single thing about what I do

As fate would have it, we do not study the same thing, or even in the same faculty, and its miraculous that we met. However none of this stops you from being my biggest supports. You keep me sane when I am lost in the competition, or rat race or whatever it is that you call it. You keep me focused on the bigger picture  well, we keep each others focused on the bigger picture. You are forgiving of my mistakes, of my egos, while being honest. You are direct, yet gentle. You told me that if one day I had lost everything, I can always run to you. I thank you for the generosity that is your company, here is to many years to come!

For future incoming first year McGillians

Before you enter the gates, whether you are feeling confused, excited, or anxious, it is all okay. Take a deep breath, and keep count, because its going to go by all too fast.

I want you to know that you DO NOT need to answer to anyone but yourself. Your job is to simply improve yourself in the ways that you seem fit provided that you are a decent person. Never mind what other people think, and what other people say. People WILL laugh and mock at the clumsy way you make efforts, and the way you struggle, but dont mind them. We mustnt equate struggling to failing. We are learning, filling in our ignorances, exercising our weakness which means that we are meant to be struggling. I am not going to lie, McGill is going to be hard, really really hard, and McGill as an institution does not make it any easier for you with its mental health policies and over 600 students classes etc.. But when it gets hardand it will, youre falling down again and again, dont beat yourself up, face it, wear it like a badge of honour. Give yourself a break if you want to, but remember that struggling is far from failing and I would even say that if you didnt struggle, that might be the biggest failure of all.

There is good news however, you are not alone in this. You will also meet amazing people. Whenever you see fit, learn from them, and let them change your life. With a little bit of luck, your time at McGill wont be the best years of your life, because you will have grown and learned so much at this place that will benefit you in the future, that your best years would have yet to come.

All the best,

S.C.

One of my students is failing  what can be done for them?,"I have a student who has been trying extremely hard all semester, but is doing very badly on each graded aspect of the course. They attend every lecture and conference, have come to nearly all of my office hour sessions for help and for their essay they had multiple sessions with the writing lab. This is definitely a student who cares and puts in effort, they just really struggle with the material or some other invisible aspect of what goes into a grade.

I have just graded their final and its really bad. I think they will pass the course with a DlowC, but this is definitely the easiest course they will take at McGill. Although I am not really their TA anymore it feels shitty to have them passing this course, but know they simply cannot succeed in future ones without some large intervention.

SSMU Base Fee Increase  Reasoning Behind,"Hi everyone! Wish I had the opportunity to write this up earlier, but finalsother tasks take priority. For the current referendum, there are two votes  one on Fall Reading Break and one on a SSMU Base fee increase. While theres been open discussion on the former, theres been no larger discussion on the latter. As a now outgoing executive who will be leaving the role May 31st, graduating McGill this December, I would like to talk briefly on the impact this fee will have towards student life and why to me, its essential.

x200B

SSMU hasnt increased its base fee in over 12 years outside of CPI indexation. The fee increase at that time was for 1, allocated only to internal space improvement that wasnt infrastructural. This would include projects like creating the stage for the ballroom, furniture throughout the building, etc. There hasnt been an increase to handle SSMUs operations in over 15 years. Simply put right now, we cant handle the desire of service that students want and desire at this moment. The current staffing breakdown of SSMU is as follows  a General Manager, an HR manager, two Staff in Operations, a Building Director with 3 staff, a Finance department with 2.5 Accountants one is part time, an IT Director, 2 Staff in Communications, and a multitude of student staff that are involved in areas such as HR to various committees that SSMU runs. The core staff that the organization has, would be around 15 people on a given year. SSMU manages over 200 student groups, a student bar, a Daycare, among many many other things. Simply put, the organization has grown beyond what its current operation levels are.

x200B

Now I dont think the organization has grown out of control whatsoever, I think that fees and systems behind it havent been adjusted over the past decade. Comparing our student fees to other comparable student unions, were incredibly low. SSMUs fee should have been indexed greater to CPI or had incremental increases over the past decade, which did not happen. The intent of this fee is to have SSMUs staffing match what the expectations are and provide strong service to the student body. The staffing can be seen in the referendum ballot, but the brief runthrough is below

x200B

x200B

Clubs and Service Staff  Full time staff, dedicated to working with student groups. Offers an additional hand to the VP Student Life and Finance to manage the groups.

x200B

Accountant Additional accountant to help financial processes with student groups. Things such as providing student groups with credit cards which was established this past fall in a more efficient manner would be a goal.

x200B

Operations Full time staff dedicated to minicourses, working with clubsstudent groups on bookingsother issues that are building related.

x200B

Governance Officer  Full time staff dedicated to managing SSMUs governance documents and committees. Ensuring that committee chairs are properly trained and that committees are functioning properly. Having oversight on groups like the Health and Dental CommitteeFunding Committee to ensure that the base is being met and mistakes are mitigated.

x200B

Public Relations Officer Addition of a full time PR person to better communicate to the student body what is going on. Making sure that students understand where to access student groups or minicourses as well as how to access things that SSMU offers such as our Therapy Lamps, Menstrual Hygiene Products, etc. This person would ensure that communication is more consistent year over year.

Ill be leaving my role in May and again, have no stake in SSMU after in a month and half. That said, when I took on my,role the end goal was to improve student life. While the impact wont be instantaneous for this staffing change, Im convinced that this will lead to a stronger SSMU, a greater experience for Clubs and Services, and a student body that has a bit more faith in SSMU than how its been the previous years. In summation, I truly believe that this increase in resources will make a major positive difference in student life. I appreciate everyone who takes the time to read this and whether or not the fee vote passes or fails, I appreciate people taking the time to weigh both sides of this vote. Im free to answer any additional clarifying questions on this.

My experience as a Queer person working for Queer McGill Fall term,"IMPORTANT CAVEAT HERE Im not saying McGill doesnt have an accepting community. My main argument is that QM does not do enough for the Queer community here at Mcgill, and it fails in its role as a service. This is not about the culture at McGill in general. Thanks.

McGill University and gay pride dont mix. Where are the flags, the stickers, the posters that say that it is okay to be gay? There are posters for various controversial causes displayed proudly throughout campus, but not one rainbow flag. This is surprising. Turn on Grindr in the McConnell basement and its clear that there is no shortage of gay representation at McGill. 

Montreal is famed for its vibrant and proud gay community, so I expected to find a thriving gay subculture at McGill. All I found were links to Queer McGill, an SSMU service that borders on the defunct. The address and location of this service is shrouded in secrecy. 

To figure out exactly where Queer McGill is, you have to talk to an anonymous staffer on Facebook. You have to subscribe to the newsletter or become part of the Queer McGill Forum on Facebook if youd like more information. It is decidedly clandestine.

Unfazed, I signed up for staffer training during activities night. Ive been openly gay for four years now, and I wanted to give back to the community. What better way to do that than become a staffer at Queer McGill? 

Reality did not meet my expectations. I found myself sitting in a corner of McGill with other Queer McGill staffers for hours each week, waiting for nonstaffers to arrive. They never did. I mentioned this oddity once while staffingI wondered out loud, how many nonstaffers come here each week? Am I just missing the peak time? The answer was an uncomfortable silence. We were waiting for Gaydot. I noticed that the retention rate of nonstaffers within the club was incredibly low. 

This is the natural result of Queer McGills design. The Queer McGill space is so safe that it protects its occupants from everyone, including the majority of the queer student population. As a formerly closeted gay dude, I know that I would never have followed two incredibly queer Facebook pages to access information about an LGBTQ club. I would not have subscribed to the newsletter on Outlook or asked someone where a safe space was on campus. For someone questioning their sexuality, its just too much, too fast. In addition, the Queer McGill web page describes it as a service by queer students, for queer students. This means that before going to the Queer McGill office, you have to admit to yourself and others that you belong within an exclusively Queer space. What this does is that it excludes the most vulnerable group that the service should be targetingpeople who are questioning their sexuality and need someone to turn to. 

There should be widely advertised spaces on campus where queer people and their straight allies can hang out openly. That way, closeted people can ease themselves into queer culture with a modicum of plausible deniability. Dont get me wrong, LGBTQ exclusive safe spaces also serve an important purpose, but they should be widely available and accessible to nonstaffers who want to reach out. Otherwise, there is no point in calling Queer McGill a service rather than a club.  

When I attempted to provide the location of the Queer McGill offices to an individual who was struggling with his sexuality, I was chastised and told not to release information on the offices whereaboutsdisregarding the fact that I sent that information to someone in need, with someone whose cultural background made him fear for his safety. If staffers are not willing to participate in crucial outreach like this, I do not think Queer McGill should be called a service. 

LGBTQ staffers should be ambassadors for all the other closeted or openly gay students on campuswe should be proud of who we are. We should start by leading through example, not by hiding in the shadows. Its time to have more pride.

If anyone from QM has questions about this post, I would be happy to respond.

Everythings ruined  please help,"I am a first year U1 engineering student in chem eng and have been in an LDR with my high school girlfriend for 3 years. Last week, she came to Montreal to visit and I introduced her to all my friends. One of my friends, lets call him Kevin for anonymity, started hitting on her all night, and I think at Tokyo he grabbed her ass thinking I didnt see. I dont know whats worse, him grabbing her ass or the fact that she didnt stop him. I asked him about it the next day and he said he was drunk and wasnt himself, and doesnt remember doing it which is obviously a lie or he wouldnt have said he wasnt himself etc..  

Yesterday I was walking back home and called my girlfriend to see if we needed any groceries. She didnt pick up the phone, which was really strange considering she usually has her phone on her. Also, it was not out of battery because it rang a couple times. My heart fluttered and I started to think the worst. Maybe I shouldnt have, but I called Kevin to see if he would pick up, and it went straight to voicemail. I started panicking so I ran as fast as I could to get home.

Main Platform Points

1. Club Banking Reform. Institutionalizing the process of teaching clubs execs how to navigate SSMUs financial processes though an always available finance workshop via Google Classroom, completing the accounting guide from this year, extending office hours early in the year, hiring student staff for the entire year and expanding the number of student staff in finance if funds are available, rewarding clubs in good standing at the end of the year with a portion of the Club Fund that is not used.
2. An Investment Plan for Services. Tackling the issue of Services holding huge surpluses while retaining the autonomy of Services to spend as they see fit. Working with SSMUs accounting department to create a system under which Services can budget future capital expenditures into their annual budget, this way money is not being carried from year to year with no purpose and Service executives can create institutional memory for large projects by giving them formal financial backing.
3. Recommitting to Socially Responsible Investment and Ethical Purchasing. Revising the termsofreference of the Financial Ethics Committee to better serve the mission of the Society. New mandate of standardsetting and review of SSMUs investment portfolio, advising on purchasing decisions, coordinating with other portfolios VPX, VPUA outreach and campaigning.
4. Modernizing the Finance Committee. Revising the Finance Committee with the new mandate of reviewing the financial impact new Legislative Council business prior to council, saving time and making debate more effective, meeting year round to propose changes to financial processes and procedures, and collecting suggestions, concerns or complaints from SSMU members.
5. Accessibility as well as Transparency. Adding executive summaries to key financial documents Where is my money going?, Annual Budget Report, rereleasing the Where is my Money Going? document after the Fall 2019 referendum period to reflect newchanged fees.
6. A New International Student Health Plan. Taking advantage of the fact that McGills Blue Cross health plan is up for negotiation this year and SSMUs plan with Studentcare to replace all or part of the Blue Cross plan with Studentcare at a lower cost for students while maintaining the same levels of coverage.

I can handle the business side,"I just received this hot pile of shit from the CS mailing list. Let me share this with you

x200B

Hi everyone!

Hi! Thanks for spamming all of McGill today.

Were contacting you guys today to see if any of you would be a good fit to work with us as a pillar in our startup.  
  
Sadly, we are under a nondisclosure agreement so I wont be able to share all the details with you in this message. Of course, if you get to the interview, we will explain the project in details after youll have signed the NDA.

If you get to the interview

Are you really not going to say any details about your super secret stealth startup?

What can be told for now is that were working on a truly groundbreaking online platform, something with great potential which has never been done before, at least, not in the way we want it to be. We also want to have investors before the end of May. So here is exactly what we need

Of course its truly ground breaking. Investors by the end of May? Are you also planning to pitch on Dragons Den?

A web developer whos not afraid to improvise, whos competent and who has a great sense of design and user experience. The person we choose will have to create our platform from scratch and run it databases, security, bug fixes, etc. This, of course, doesnt exclude the use of Stack Overflow, templates and other tools. Were not psychopaths. 

You LITERALLY dont know what web development is.

Web developer ! Database engineer ! Security engineer ! Designer ! UX engineer

To see if you have the skills necessary, ask yourself Could I build a website similar to Airbnb in appearance and functionality using everything at my disposition? If the answer is yes, youre good enough.

What the fuck. Airbnb has over 1000 engineers. The only person who would say yes to this question is as psychotic as you.

Skills are good, but the most important thing for us for is passion. We want someone who is ready to invest himherself in our project completely and be as driven by it as we are. Were looking big and wont stop before were on top. If this is the spirit you want in your work and if youve always been looking for a startup to be a part of, youre the person were looking for.

What does MLM mean? 

As said before, youll play a major part in our startup and we are looking for the longterm. This is why the chosen candidate will receive shares of the company. Well work as a team and we want everyone to gain true value for their work in the long run. The team spirit is also crucial to us, so were looking for someone friendly with a great sense of humor if youre a Game of Thrones fan, write it in your motivation letter. This is a big plus.

Shares dont pay the bills. Long term with no pay... your developers are going to be so happy. Wow I have the opportunity to watch GOT with you? Id rather not

If youre interested, ready to jump in as soon as possible and think you have the right characteristics, please send us a motivation letter with your portfolio. We also ask for your CV but we are far more interested in your personality and the quality of your work. You can send everything to REDACTEDgmail.commailtoredactedgmail.com .

What the fuck is a motivation letter? And a CV is necessary? And a portfolio? You dont even have a company email bro

If you pass the first selection round, well contact you for a live interview as soon as we can. The sooner you can start, the better.  
  
TLDR If youre a skilled web developer who wants to invest yourself in a groundbreaking startup, be a part of a fun team and be able to create something truly great which will bring value to thousands of people, be paid not by your time but by the quality of your work over the longterm, if youre tired of letting your life pass you by and want to take control of it by using your skills to create something truly yours which youll be really proud of, send us your motivation letter, portfolio and CV. If we we think youd be a good fit, well set up an interview for you to learn more about the project and for us to make our final choice.

Actual TLDR If youre a skilled web developer who wants to burn out while working for a psychopath business student with an unnamed idea for fake money, apply to this company.

Looking forward to connecting with you!

I look forward to shitting in front of your house!

U1 PHAR MAJOR SCHEDULE ADVICE,"Hey everyone! I have a question for science majors out there. 

Im in my second year, U1, as a pharmacology major. This past term I took all the courses that pharm majors have to take BIO 200, CHEM 212, PHGY 209, PHGY 212, PHAR 200 which is an easy A but only 1 credit, plus my elective which was MUAR 211, another easy A. Honestly I found this semester to be really tough, even though I studied as much as I physically could for BIOPHGYCHEM, and my GPA took a hit. 

Next semester Im taking BIOC 212, PHGY 210, PHGY 213, CHEM 222, PHAR 201, plus an elective. Im currently thinking COMP 250 because I took COMP 202 and really liked it  did well, although I had prior knowledge of Java and I actually spent a lot of time doing the assignments for 202. I want to take COMP 250 because I feel like it would be interesting and I havent heard particularly horrible things about it as in I heard the exams are fair and the material isnt insanely difficult or whatever, but Im also desperately trying to raise my GPA bc I need to get into grad school!!. 

Does anyone have any advice?  Does BIOC 212, PHGY 210, PHGY 213, CHEM 222, PHAR 2O1 and COMP 250 seem manageable?? Or should I stick to a guaranteed easyA for an elective?

It is your favourite McGill Dad over here. Happy Christmas! I have a message for everyone worried and anguished during your holiday.,"My daughter, whom spends many late hours trolling about this online abode, came home from McGill for the holidays. As I imagine many of you are, she was crushed by some grades. It has not been her most successful few semesters, and shes of the conviction her life is coming apart. I told her over Christmas dinner what I saw as my duty to tell you all. More people need to tell the younger generation the following

x200B

This does not matter.

x200B

Dont get me wrong. School is important. I learned a lot in college. What they teach you in college is fundamentally important, and it will make your mindset systematic and teach you the bare bones framework of thinking. But the first thing my first boss told me was, forget what you learned and do not remember it. After that job, by the way, no one nary asked what school I finished, let alone my GPA. I managed to, nevertheless, become a very successful businessman in a niche market export and shipping. Friends I had who took college far too seriously are grubbing between dusty book covers and cant take a vacation further than the coast.

x200B

It will seem almost impossible to realize this right now, but your professors arent the smartest people in the world. Theyre not even very smart, full stop. They have dedicated their lives to living in learning, instead of living in doing. And if you want to make money, you have to do. You have to produce, not memorize books and produce hackneyed papers that peddle your dogmatic views. I know it is hard to truly grasp it right now, but you will remember me when you come to understand that your professors were false idols, and that college was an entire cult of polytheistic false idols.

x200B

Work on people skills. Work on your network. Grow your capabilities. College does not matter. Have more fun and go out more. Take it from me, you are far more likely to meet a lifelong business connection partying than you are to work for that added .01 GPA point.

x200B

Be merry, be mirthy, and take life easy. I wish you all more relaxation, focus, and remember to laugh once in a while.

x200B

I am a prospective student from the West Coast of the USA. Howdy. I really want to go to McGill. It seems like an awesome place and I would get to practice mon francais which nest pas tres bon. My counselor, my parents all support me, but I am put off by the fact that a couple of index put McGill as the school with some of the most miserable students on the continent. Princeton Universitys index puts McGill in the top 20 of most miserable schools and least accessible teachers. A few others echo the same stuff.

Isolation from native Montrealers might be why Mcgill is so depressing?,"Unlike other systems in Canada students from Quebec go to CEGEP which is like grade 12 and then grade 13 for university preparation, or a 3 year course. This results in people that are Mcgill freshmen from out of province or out of country not being in the same freshmen classes as montrealers since montrealers skip the 1st year university and go to 2nd. So basically you wont be able to easily make friendships with people from Montreal and you will feel extremely isolated when people you know leave for holidays or just leave entirely. Am I right in thinking this? Im not attending MCgill now but was thinking of attending and I just keep thinking of this. If I attend Mcgill will I really have like 0 connections with people from Montreal? At least it will be more difficult then basically any other universities.


Edit People do things like transfer universities and sometimes just simply leave the city a university is in after Graduation. If you have no connection to people from that city and dont really have a chance a lot of your university years since first year is definetely a big part in forming friendships you will just feel isolated and depressed. I just feel like Mcgill students dont have a chance to properly connection with Montreal and people from Montreal since the school system is different here then anywhere else in USACanada and a lot of other places to.

Academic Boycott of Alleged Abusers,"There are several known and alleged abusers at McGill. A list even, known by several but not enough. Even with these open secrets, why are we still supporting these professors who have been accused of sexual misconduct in the academic arena? 

Taking courses with known abusers, attending events with known abusers, taking letters of rec from known abusers...ie saw a CJPME event today featuring a known abuser with several students in attendance. 

In my opinion any sort of event featuring a prof who has committed sexual misconduct should be boycotted. We should not support and reinforce that these professors can get away with anything and still receive the fanfare and idolization. It is frustrating to me when people, such as the PSSA, include professors such as this in student events. But then again, we are all here to goddamn learn. Where is the middle ground? Perhaps it should not reflect on a students decision to attend, but on the organization willing to promote such people? 

This post is meant to start a conversation. I am curious where people stand on this.

Just wanted to provide access! Feel free to ask me about getting involved! Some of the students I have helped usher into the scene have already gotten booked for weekends at comedy clubs or headlined indie shows in the city. I can also give advice on producing your own stuff if you want! 

This coming year I will have

Gerts Comedy Hour biweekly

Reggies Bar show concordia

Open Air Comedy 

and The Dropout! Show 

I can give you tips on open mics, which shows are the best in the city for seeing valuewise as well. I can even put you in touch with other students I got involved if you are interested! Ive been interviewed on CKUT, the tribune, and some random clickbait website once if that makes any credibility. I am a year into comedy and my psychology TA got me involved. I have opened and hosted weekends at The Comedyworks and other shows around the city! Would love to help anyone interested try to get on stage or go support their local students

I dont know what to think anymore,"Hi everyone ! Long story short  Ive just finished my first year in Management here at McGill. Its been a rough year from the start, I hated every subject I took since now and Ive been delaying most of my management classes to take electives to give me a break. Being someone extremely analytical et interested in mathematics, I felt like my management classes were just random bullshit that lacked rigour. The only courses that I enjoyed were economics courses. As such, Ive applied to different schools and I got accepted in a European school to do a BSc in quantitative economics, which is something I am eager to study. The problem is that today, my father graduated from the MBA and when I saw all the BCom graduates, I just felt like a huge failure. I mean, I just dont understand how they made it. Each time I took a management course, I ended up dropping it given how unatural it felt to me. I just dont really know what to think anymore.

BCommerce McGill VS Queens," Im currently a Grade 12 student debating between Desautels Faculty of Management and Smith School of Business at Queens and at McGill. I know posting this on the McGill subreddit may be slightly bias but I would like to hear your thoughts. Ive also posted on the queens

  
My ultimate goal is to end up in the US either in IB or Management Consulting. I could be wrong but that would entail a honors in economics and finance right?How would the two school programs compare on a scale of 1 to 10 with respect to the following factors

1. Undergraduate Employability
2. Reputation Internationally US
3. Reputation Canada

I asking knowing business industry tend to have poor income equality with respect to salaries which justifying the statement up or out of the industry. I come from a nonbusiness household so I wouldnt exactly have the strongest network from the get go. Unlike STEM majors eg. CS where even if your not the top 1037 you can still graduate knowing youll make a decent living. Commerce as a whole has a lot of uncertainty. For this reason I am concerned that if I dont make the right moves in commerce its out as soon as Im done school.

Thank you,"I had to create a throwaway because the content of this is quite personal and a lot of people at McGill are aware of my reddit handle Im really active on this sub and I have a really obvious handle.



A few months ago, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma and in few months one to be exact, I will finish my second and final cycle of treatment. I decided to continue studying at McGill while going through this. It was tiring, but I came out okay. My professors and OSD were very kind, accommodating my many annoying demands. I initially felt so defeated until I found my support group who helped through everything including a McGill YA cancer survivor group which im so thankful for. I soon realised that so many people around me were going through some serious problems, but I was so blissfully unaware of my surroundings. 




The reason im posting this here today is because I wanted to thank you guys. I was going through a difficult time not too long ago and everything seemed bleak. My health and relationships crumbled and I felt lost and so so tired. It was during those times that I used to browse reddit frequently. This sub was one of the many subs i posted in frequented and I felt useful to a great extent. It might be kind of ludicrous for someone to feel a sense of self worth through reddit I personally dont think it is, but I did... so thank you.  



After this, I eventually started getting more resources and finding my community. I came to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason.







For any of you out there who are going through a tough time... It will get better, trust me. I keep you in my thoughts and I know you can get through this. 







And for many of you who know someone going through a tough time.. Please stick by them even if they dont ask you too. Most often, people wont make such requests but believe me...your support matters.

"So many attractive people around campus, how will I ever meet them all?","I see people Im attracted to all around campus all the time but always at places where they cant  probably dont want to be approached.

Vote NO for the Daily Referendum to stop imposing mandatory charges to ALL students,"Ok before I start, some people will be offended by me because I am ruining their interest. Although this must be spoken for the sake of the more general student body!


First of all, the referendum is NOT about whether the two student bodies will cease to exist or not, its about whether we, the students, should keep paying the MANDAOTRY 6 per SEMESTER for them. They can exist, but the fee must be OPTOUTABLE!

Its simple. Daily IS biased, IS forbidding to transmit some particular voices, IS HIGHLY cost, and IS adding to the diversity of the publications by providing a strongtoned voice. 

There are sufficient reasons to vote no

1 If you think they are biased, andor you think their content is stupid, I see no reason why you HAVE to be forced to pay for it. Quote from uThe12thDoc The Daily actively works to exclude voices that disagree with their editorial line. Thats not how newspapers are supposed to work. Even for the rest of the people who reads them, you shouldnt force people who dont like to pay for it! Its like a service, if I dont like it, I should not be paying for it, if you cant get enough money, something went wrong or they cost too much! If everyone opts Daily out in the fees, only then they can realize that they are doing something bad with their content! They must confront the truth rather than hide behind the invisible wall of mandatory fees. People who will read Daily will still keep on paying for it, so if they cannot run with the money their audience pay, they should do something! Right now it is a FORCED equilibrium, if we dont vote no doesnt mean it WONT happen in the future. Again, I have said, they can go all online  without printing, itll save us money, save them money, and the ones genuinely interested in you guys will still read it, everyones happy! 

2 If you dont care about these stupid oncampus issues or never read the Daily anyways, I see no reason why you have to pay for it. People must understand that some others value one thing less, and just because you value this more doesnt mean you MUST make others care AND pay for it! Thats fascism! How selfish can you guys be for letting others pay for something that only you guys are interested in! People are disconnected with McGill, and we do not care about any of this. Besides, there are a QUITE a few people out here with financial difficulties, 63 a semester IS a lot, you CANNOT just not give them a choice of optout this for food! Dont be too narcissistic, we are really just students, nothing counts.!

Lastly, if Daily still cannot run with an optoutable fee, and remains this biased, I say it is definitively better to dissolve it and rebuild it. Rather than having some inconsiderate and incompetent people harvesting 6 from us every semester, I rather let them build another publication that relies on actual revenue rather than free money forced upon us. Besides, note it down, Daily says they are independent from other societies but rely on us, but where on earth are there accountabilities? If it doesnt voice the students need but instead publishes whatever the editors want, why the hell should the students pay for it, huh?

I know some people WILL get mad and WILL downvote this and will NOT directly answer my arguments but say stuff, but we NEED a discussion here, but more than a discussion, we need a NO on the referendum. Its our money, we get to say what we do with it! Consider for the poor, not for yourself, please. Incompetent organizations disliked by the student body should fade out, no matter whether it voices another point of stand. Natural selection for yall! 

besides, SSMU Mental Health Fee SSMM isnt even mandatory, how are you guys charging more than them AND making ur fees mandatory?

Edit Clearly, Ive gone a bit too far with my words. It was supposedly a shit disturber to relieve all that very very draining and dreadful stress, but I illustrated some points. Im glad this got people more involved in whats going on. And no, I wont change my stance cuz I AM poor, and I do believe the press moving online is better for everyone.

Questions about McGills Computer Science program,"Hello,

I am a grade 12 Ontario high school student accepted to McGills computer science program. However, Ive been having trouble finding information about the program, and also have some questions regarding it. If anyone could help myself, and potentially other students by answering what you know about any of the following questions, that would be really helpful to us all in making our postsecondary decisions!

So there is information about what courses are to be taken in the McGill CS program httpwww.mcgill.castudy20172018facultiesscienceundergraduateprogramsbachelorsciencebscmajorcomputerscience

However, I have a few questions regarding that link

1. I assume the first digit of the course code indicates what year the course is intended for. However, the courses in that link all start at 2, and some of them end in 5. Are the courses that start with 2 designated for the first year students?

2. It says at the bottom The remaining credits are selected from computer science courses at the 300 level or above. Where can I find access to information about these courses in the later years? Could someone provide a link to them?

3. Is there a suggested course sequence schedule for McGill computer science, like the one presented here?  httpscs.uwaterloo.cacurrentprogramssuggested20152016bcs 
	This layout shows the courses I would take in each semester of each year.

4. I am looking for a program that will challenge me academically. How difficult are the courses in McGills CS program, and are there any advanced courses that I can take to challenge myself?

5. This question is not regarding course information, rather summer internships and co op positions. I would like a university which keeps me busy during the summer all four years. I know that McGills CS program has no specified coop feature, however Ive heard online about internships being offered for the CS students. How do those work? Are there services provided by McGill university to help you get those internships, or is it completely up to the individual to seek them out and apply for them? Is there anywhere online where one could find more information about internships for computer science students at McGill, and would anyone like to share their experience with internships in this program? Also, would being weak in French be a disadvantage for software internships?

Thank you very much for all of your help! And to other prospective students, Im sure if you have your own questions you can leave them in the comments and someone could start a discussion with you about them.

Dreading returning to mcgill. I have zero friends and feel people reject me due to the color of my skin.,"So I am dreading going back to mcgill for my 2nd year. In my first year I made an effort to meet people, and I genuinely am a nice and kind person but while people respond to me positively, they always kind of push me away and dont want to be more than acquaintances. 

My family lived in Belgium, Switzerland and France for most of my life, and culturally I am not that different despite being born in an African country and having dark skin, yet if I sit down in class or at a library, usually the seats next to me are the last resort ones and never get filled until the place is absolutely full.

I actually spent most of my summer alone and recently went to see my family and I was actually slightly happier alone then during the school year, cause I could just go around and explore the city on my own and not be going to classes and spending time on campus feeling like I am the only one without a friend next to them. 

I joined a club for a while, did not make things much better and I eventually left it.

It is horrible to feel like I have no one and I really had a hard time coping, after a while I began to just feel scared to approach anyone potentially missing out on meeting people. I know other minorities seem to face similar problems less so for east asians cause the media has not negatively stereotyped them as much.

Im not going to say everyone is horrible but it sure feels a lot of people at least in the classes I take want to distance themselves from me. And even more strange that I am a guy and if I have to ask something from a stranger, girls tend to be a bit nicer than guys. Not that I have a problem with that and in my first semester there were 2 girls who did not seem like they were pushing me away, but one of them has since transfered and the other is now an exchange student. 

In second year it will probably be even harder now that everyone has their friend groups.

I dont know what to do, I almost had a breakdown last semester and even cried on occasion alone in my room about it. I did not live in rez.

I know this seems like pulling the race card and honestly I dont know if that is the issue but it sure feels like it from my perspective. The worst is I have to pretend like I am fine and content and put on a fake smile everytime and it kills me.

I never felt this in Belgium where I spent most of my life, however I will say that when I stayed in Germany for a while it was much worse and sometimes seemed openly so. I just wish people just saw me as a person too  .

Once when I entered a tutorial, there were some quebecer students behind me and they were saying pretty negetive things about me i think  and  minority culture and it hurt. They did not probably know that I understood French.

How can I let all this not affect me and just be alone and happy. I am tempted to take some time off and transfer elsewhere because of this.",1469947006,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/4vg0n5/dreading_returning_to_mcgill_i_have_zero_friends/,21,mcgillloony,4vg0n5,7/31/2016 6:36,"['dreading', 'going', 'back', 'mcgill', 'nd', 'year.', 'first', 'year', 'made', 'effort', 'meet', 'people', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'kind', 'person', 'people', 'respond', 'positively', 'always', 'kind', 'push', 'away', 'dont', 'want', 'acquaintances.', 'family', 'lived', 'belgium', 'switzerland', 'france', 'life', 'culturally', 'different', 'despite', 'born', 'african', 'country', 'dark', 'skin', 'yet', 'sit', 'class', 'library', 'usually', 'seats', 'next', 'last', 'resort', 'ones', 'never', 'get', 'filled', 'place', 'absolutely', 'full.', 'actually', 'spent', 'summer', 'alone', 'recently', 'went', 'see', 'family', 'actually', 'slightly', 'happier', 'alone', 'school', 'year', 'cause', 'could', 'go', 'around', 'explore', 'city', 'going', 'classes', 'spending', 'time', 'campus', 'feeling', 'like', 'one', 'without', 'friend', 'next', 'them.', 'joined', 'club', 'make', 'things', 'much', 'better', 'eventually', 'left', 'it.', 'horrible', 'feel', 'like', 'one', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'coping', 'began', 'feel', 'scared', 'approach', 'anyone', 'potentially', 'missing', 'meeting', 'people.', 'know', 'minorities', 'seem', 'face', 'similar', 'problems', 'less', 'east', 'asians', 'cause', 'media', 'negatively', 'stereotyped', 'much.', 'im', 'going', 'say', 'everyone', 'horrible', 'sure', 'feels', 'lot', 'people', 'least', 'classes', 'take', 'want', 'distance', 'me.', 'even', 'strange', 'guy', 'ask', 'something', 'stranger', 'girls', 'tend', 'bit', 'nicer', 'guys.', 'problem', 'first', 'semester', 'girls', 'seem', 'like', 'pushing', 'away', 'one', 'since', 'transfered', 'exchange', 'student.', 'second', 'year', 'probably', 'even', 'harder', 'everyone', 'friend', 'groups.', 'dont', 'know', 'almost', 'breakdown', 'last', 'semester', 'even', 'cried', 'occasion', 'alone', 'room', 'it.', 'live', 'rez.', 'know', 'seems', 'like', 'pulling', 'race', 'card', 'honestly', 'dont', 'know', 'issue', 'sure', 'feels', 'like', 'perspective.', 'worst', 'pretend', 'like', 'fine', 'content', 'put', 'fake', 'smile', 'everytime', 'kills', 'me.', 'never', 'felt', 'belgium', 'spent', 'life', 'however', 'say', 'stayed', 'germany', 'much', 'worse', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'openly', 'so.', 'wish', 'people', 'saw', 'person', '.', 'entered', 'tutorial', 'quebecer', 'students', 'behind', 'saying', 'pretty', 'negetive', 'things', 'think', 'minority', 'culture', 'hurt.', 'probably', 'know', 'understood', 'french.', 'let', 'affect', 'alone', 'happy.', 'tempted', 'take', 'time', 'transfer', 'elsewhere', 'this.']",1,1,0,0

"Technician position available in Downey Lab uOttawa cell signaling, genetics, proteomics","
My lab technician will be accepting a position in a PharmD program and so the Downey Lab is recruiting for a fulltime technician position to start in MidAugust 2016.  

The candidate would be responsible for assisting in ongoing research projects, lab ordering and, in coordination with Dr. Downey, training new undergraduate and graduate students in standard lab practices.

Strong attention to detail, ability to work as a team, and experience with tissue culture is essential for this position. The position could work well for someone looking to gain additional experience prior to application to competitive PhD programs.

If interested please contact Dr. Downey at mdowne2uottawa.ca with a CV and statement of interest. Letters of reference will be expected at a later date from shortlisted candidates, but these can also accompany the CV. 

Salary will be commensurate with education and experience. Familiarity with uOttawa ordering systems is an asset but not an essential requirement.

About the Downey Lab

Research in the Downey lab focuses on cell signaling and posttranslational modifications. A major theme in the lab is the intersection of nonhistone protein acetylation and cellular stress responses. We are also interested in cooperation and competition between unique posttranslational modifications. The research direction is constantly evolving  if we see something cool and reproducible, well willing to work on it. Our lab uses the yeast model system with some work in human cell lines. The recruited applicant will likely help to expand our tissue culture work in coordination with a recently recruited postdoc.

"Accepted to McGill, should I take a gap year? Do you regret not taking oneare glad you took one?","Hey Mcgillians,

Ive been accepted to McGill to start next year, and my dad had always been against taking a gap year. Last night we had a good discussion and I convinced him, so now its my decision. The catch is A He will only pay for a plane ticket to and from a destination of my choice not really a catch, Ill have roughly 5 grand saved up by working by the end of August and most gap years are taken on a budget and work and travel programs are popular, but something to consider. B My parents, if I go now, will pay for all 4 years, tuition and rent and all, however my dad said that that he doesnt know if he will be able to pay for my 4th year if I take a gap year. Not sure how possible this is, Im pretty sure hell still be able to pay for it, but if he cant is a gap year worth the student loans I would have to take out in that scenario? Itd be about 1520k with rent and tuition, Im from BC, so out of province Canadian. Hes giving me a deadline of May 15th to give him a decision, and Im not even sure where I would go, maybe NZ or Aus, so I need to do some research. Anyways, regardless of where I would go, my point of this post is to ask if anyone has some insight on a gap year, and like the title says, are the takers glad they traveled, are the experiences worth it, and are the people who didnt go regretting it?

"Hi rMcGill, Im Samosa Searchs Vice President of Quality Assurance, Kapil, AMA Ask Mose Anything!","Hi rMcGill, 

If youve been on campus for the past year and a half, youve undoubtably heard of the widely popular McGill group Samosa Searchhttpswww.facebook.comgroups720504868069082. 

Samosas are a large part of McGill Society, and their student bodys gastrointestinal tract. McGill students have embraced this new group with open arms just like their intestinal bacteria has embraced the frequent samosas and chutney.

As you may know, this group was started by my classmate Tyler Money Sean, after he ate his first McGill Samosa, in Jan 2015. He quickly fell in love, and the Search was born. The search has revolutionized the way students embrace and find samosas sales on campus. It has become a culture, and stress reliever. The search are contributing positively to both students sanity and satiety. 

As a community, weve embraced the term Mose, come up with the MOSE 10 COMMANDMENTS, have had articles written about Samosa Search by the Tribunehttpwww.mcgilltribune.comstudentlivingsamosasearchshakesupmcgillsamosagame65435679, come out with Mosecumenteries on TVMhttptvmtelevision.comtagsamosasearch, had people come up with raps, instructional videos on how to best infuse chutney now called chut, and even made McGill Mose shirts! 

There have been controversies on the Search the Churro V Samosa debate, Sales V Search, YIntersection V PsiIntersection, Straw V Spoon, etc, and many good times as well. 

I would like to take a moment to share my appreciation with the McGill reddit community and answer any burnsideing questions related to Samosa Search. 

Ask me Anything!

Questions about grad school living,"So my girlfriend and I are in our third year at U of T. Shes in neuroscience and Im in psychology both specialist and were both planning on going to McGill for neuroscience. Shes more interested in chemical and cellular neuroscience and I am more interested in behavioural neuropharmacology theres about 7 or so supervisors that specialize in that. She has a 4.0 cGPA and I have a 3.74 cGPA, and both of us have quite a bit of research experience so getting in is a fairly reasonable possibility yes I know its not guaranteed but its looking good so far. She graduated from high school with a 99.6 average and is getting paid to go to school and I managed to save enough money to be graduating debtfree, with about 7,000 to spare parents paid for first year. Im sorry if this sounds like a lot of bragging I just want to get as much info as possible on the post. 

My girlfriend is also quite wealthy. Her parents are giving her around 100,000 when she graduates to get a place to live, and were definitely going to be living together. I know the stipend for IPN is enough to cover tuition and food but it doesnt seem like it covers rent.

"McGill asking for transcript, not given option to upload.","According to the McGill website, I need to upload an unofficial transcript for my application to be reviewed However, Minerva and McGills website are very unclear on this matter, and I am unable to properly provide my document since I am not being given the proper information.

Transcripts received via the upload process are considered unofficial. If you are offered admission, you will then need to provide official transcripts sent to us by mail in a sealed envelope directly from the institution. Your offer of admission will be contingent upon the receipt and verification of your official documents. Please do not send official records until we request them.
httpswww.mcgill.caapplyingiveappliednowwhatsubmityoursupportingdocumentspreparingyourdocuments

Also in the FAQ

My official transcript was sent in the mail. Should I upload the unofficial transcript?

To ensure the completeness of your file, you should upload an unofficial transcript. An official transcript must be sent directly by your high schoolcollegeuniversity only if you are admitted.
httpswww.mcgill.caapplyingiveappliednowwhatsubmityoursupportingdocumentsfaq

This is my checklist on Minerva Note that I do not have a link to upload an unofficial transcript. httpimgur.comjKWKyGI


Based on this information, I cannot submit my final high school transcript as described above. I do not have a link to upload.

Therefore, if this is not a mistake, a transcript needs to be mailed in. My high school has my transcript and I have paid for it to be mailed to McGill. However, if it is mailed to McGill, would it not be an official transcript? How can it be possible that I am not supposed to submit an official transcript to McGill when my only option is to have it mailed in from my high school?

There is clearly a contradiction in the information provided. I am being asked to upload or provide something I cannot. My official transcript is coming to McGill as it is the only way I can send a transcript despite the fact that, according to McGills website, I am not supposed to and cannot be given admission unless I upload an unofficial transcript that I am not being given an option to provide.

What I am supposed to do with this piece of documentation? Anyone else have any experience with this type of thing? Ive contacted Service Point but they are taking a long time to reply.

"SSMU Base Fee Increase AMA Saturday, January 23rd 400 pm  600 pm","Every year, the SSMU offers more and more services to the growing undergraduate population. The base fee, which has not been raised in nearly eight years, is now stretched very thin. This means that students with great ideas and the ambition to carry these ideas out are being turned down for lack of funds, and the services we currently offer are becoming increasingly harder to sustain. With this fee increase, the SSMU will be able to support and help improve the student groups, contribute to mental health services, create more student jobs, enhance student spaces and improve the financial sustainability of all the SSMUs operations.

This AMA is created to provide greater insight on projects SSMU sustains and wants to further expand on, to improve YOUR McGill experience. Kimber, Omar and Zach will be answering your questions! For more information

Can a professor fail half the class? Failed Math 264,"Hi,

So I failed MATH 264 with Sidney Trudeau and so did so many others who had 2 or 3 exams the first week of exams.

I knew the material ok but the final exam was very hard. People with near 4.0 GPAs got Bs and Bs and everyone else seems to have failed.

Trudeau said he would not curve the class despite this and the grades are already on the transcript. Is there any chance of curving after it is on the transcript?

The course was definitely way harder than past 264 final exams. 

Arent their department rules to maintain a specific average and ensure a certain percentage of people pass?

Or does mcgill intentionally do this so we have to retake it and they get paid more?

Sid was a good prof in class but all his exams were just insane. I put in a lot of work in this class yet still failed.

"Got a 49.28 for a class, asking prof for a bump to 50?","I fucked up and did really poorly in a class. Its in Arts and I got a really shit grade because I didnt do an assignment thus got a zero on it that was worth 22 of my grade because I was in a bad place after someone I knew committed suicide. I had emailed my TA the day before it was due asking for an extension for the assignment and told him the reason and he gave me one but I didnt check my email for about a week after. I was in a really really bad place emotionally and didnt put any energy towards anything for about a week after she killed herself and thats why I didnt check my email. By the time I checked it, I saw that he HAD given me an extension but the extra time he gave me already ended before I saw it, so he said it was too late for me to do the assignment.

I dont know what to do. 

Is it possible for me to get the grade itself off my transcript? Should I explain everything to the professor and best case scenario get a D instead of an F?

How good is McGills MSc in Computer Science?,"Hi All,

I just got an admit to McGills Thesis MSc in Computer Science.

I have these following questions,

1. How good is the McGill CS Grad program?  I know its behind UofT, UBC, Waterloo, does that still make it a top program ?
2. How does McGill hold up against top 10 Univs in USA ? 
3. Hows McGills reputation in the international job market ? Do CS grads from McGill have a good reputation in the industry ?
4. Hows the job market in Canada for CS graduates ?
5. A more open question Im right now in a decent paying job in a great company, doing quite alright, what would a MSc from McGill value to add to my current profile?

It is time to abolish SSMU serious post.,"Dear fellow Marlets and Redmen !!

I am verry happy with McGill overall, except with SSMU.

SSMU for sure might have done or do some cool stuff. For example it is a SSMU initiative that the McLennan Library is still 24h, SSMU also created a fund for financial aid so that we make sure everyone can make it through McGill. But in more than twenty years of existence this is very little. In fact, SSMU is mostly about badly managing our money, not saying wasting it. How could we assess the efficiency of SSMU at addressing students needs, desires and issues? Because SSMU is not transparent, accountable or communicative, we cannot. 

But there is something that really makes me feel bad about SSMU. It is the culture and the structure. SSMU is a very political organization, and its essence is that it is dominated by conflict. Most of what SSMU is about creates, nourishes, defends or tries to justify contentious ideas, behaviours and actions. 

I crave a peaceful, non political environment, to study and learn as much as I can. I believe that we are too young to have our opinions set and become narrowminded activists. Every idea should be tried to be understood, nobody holds the truth. 

SSMU contentious nature generates apathy regarding innovative, creative andor cultural projets. 

Finally, SSMU is an horrible joke to democracy. It is so obvious there is no need to develop this point.


So my question is If you believe like me that SSMU should be abolished but for different reasons, what are they?

A way in which Kareem Ibrahims victory can be invalidated? looking at Kareems lies,"Kareems victory was VERY narrow, receiving a few more percent of the vote with a large number of abstainers. I think that Kareems victory, however, was due in part to his liesassumptions, some of which implied Alexei was involved in Kharaldi gate scandal which hes shown no solid proof for.

1
Firstly, Kareem never corrected his post that Thomas Anderson as NOT a nonSSMU member and NOT a campaigner for Alexei. This could have heavily swayed opinion as this comment generated many more likes than Thomas Andersons correction of Kareems post.

x

x




2
Moreover, Kareem demonstrated almost nonexistent proof that Alexei communicated with Khan, despite saying it in a post with over 300 likes. His proof was that Alexei said voter intimidation to Kareem, allegedly before Khan had posted his intent to sue Kareem.



 First of all, there is no way to verify if Alexei did say voter intimidation

 Second of all, even if he had said those words, Kareem could have misheard

 Third if he had said those words, it doesnt necessarily mean he communicated with Khan. Maybe a friendofafriend told Alexei

 Fourth you dont know every location where Khan posted his intent to sue. Alexei could have probably seen that post of Khans on a post, posted wellbefore he contacted you. Kareem had NO PROOF that Khan had never posted his intent to sue before Alexei allegedly talked to Khan.

The fact that Kareem claimed Khan and Alexei colluded against you would have had a huge impact on the voters decision to abstain rather than vote for Kareem. If voters thought that it was Alexei doing a smear campaign which Kareem implied but have no solid evidence for they would have been much more likely to abstain rather than vote for Kareem.

x

x

3 Finally, it is pretty evident that Kareem lied about whether his proposal to illegally invade Khans privacy was a joke.

 He at first says, that his statementhttpimgur.coma1wvXN was an ideahttpimgur.comczTZVrT, but just one that desperate and inappropriate. 

 Then, he claims that it was a jokehttpimgur.comzKee9KW.

Now, this would have contributed hugely to whether or not Kareem won. In his pinned post, where he had claimed it was a joke, he received 300 likes  even more than Khans claim that he was going to sue Kareem. The fact that this was a pinned post, with high visibility, means that many people saw it and agreed with it. It also means, for the people that saw the post, that many actually believed his original statement was a joke. And thats a big deal, because then it implies that what Kareem had made a joke, rather than an actual proposal to hack Khan which was what Kareem had originally admitted tohttpimgur.comczTZVrT.",1426973898,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/2zuebu/a_way_in_which_kareem_ibrahims_victory_can_be/,19,PersonAtMcGill,2zuebu,3/21/2015 21:38,"['kareems', 'victory', 'narrow', 'receiving', 'percent', 'vote', 'large', 'number', 'abstainers.', 'think', 'kareems', 'victory', 'however', 'due', 'part', 'liesassumptions', 'implied', 'alexei', 'involved', 'kharaldi', 'gate', 'scandal', 'hes', 'shown', 'solid', 'proof', 'for.', 'firstly', 'kareem', 'never', 'corrected', 'post', 'thomas', 'anderson', 'nonssmu', 'member', 'campaigner', 'alexei.', 'could', 'heavily', 'swayed', 'opinion', 'comment', 'generated', 'many', 'likes', 'thomas', 'andersons', 'correction', 'kareems', 'post.', 'x', 'x', 'moreover', 'kareem', 'demonstrated', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'proof', 'alexei', 'communicated', 'khan', 'despite', 'saying', 'post', 'likes.', 'proof', 'alexei', 'said', 'voter', 'intimidation', 'kareem', 'allegedly', 'khan', 'posted', 'intent', 'sue', 'kareem.', 'first', 'way', 'verify', 'alexei', 'say', 'voter', 'intimidation', 'second', 'even', 'said', 'words', 'kareem', 'could', 'misheard', 'third', 'said', 'words', 'doesnt', 'necessarily', 'mean', 'communicated', 'khan.', 'maybe', 'friendofafriend', 'told', 'alexei', 'fourth', 'dont', 'know', 'every', 'location', 'khan', 'posted', 'intent', 'sue.', 'alexei', 'could', 'probably', 'seen', 'post', 'khans', 'post', 'posted', 'wellbefore', 'contacted', 'you.', 'kareem', 'proof', 'khan', 'never', 'posted', 'intent', 'sue', 'alexei', 'allegedly', 'talked', 'khan.', 'fact', 'kareem', 'claimed', 'khan', 'alexei', 'colluded', 'would', 'huge', 'impact', 'voters', 'decision', 'abstain', 'rather', 'vote', 'kareem.', 'voters', 'thought', 'alexei', 'smear', 'campaign', 'kareem', 'implied', 'solid', 'evidence', 'would', 'much', 'likely', 'abstain', 'rather', 'vote', 'kareem.', 'x', 'x', 'finally', 'pretty', 'evident', 'kareem', 'lied', 'whether', 'proposal', 'illegally', 'invade', 'khans', 'privacy', 'joke.', 'first', 'says', 'statement', 'idea', 'one', 'desperate', 'inappropriate.', 'claims', 'joke', 'would', 'contributed', 'hugely', 'whether', 'kareem', 'won.', 'pinned', 'post', 'claimed', 'joke', 'received', 'likes', 'even', 'khans', 'claim', 'going', 'sue', 'kareem.', 'fact', 'pinned', 'post', 'high', 'visibility', 'means', 'many', 'people', 'saw', 'agreed', 'it.', 'also', 'means', 'people', 'saw', 'post', 'many', 'actually', 'believed', 'original', 'statement', 'joke.', 'thats', 'big', 'deal', 'implies', 'kareem', 'made', 'joke', 'rather', 'actual', 'proposal', 'hack', 'khan', 'kareem', 'originally', 'admitted']",1,0,0,0

Course suggestions,"Hi, I am entering McGill this fall as a U0 student who has completed AP Chemistry in HS. I got a 4 on my exam and read the McGill policy saying the credit will be granted CHEM 110120. Having studied more than half of the material by myself, I thought Id take it to review and maybe learn concepts that I didnt cover in my own study. I contacted the science academic advisor and the person told me that I can retake the course CHEM 110120 with no credit. She also mentioned that I may be excluded from the scholarship, but I couldnt find any information about that in McGill eCalendar. 

I would like to be considered in the scholarship candidate pool near future and now I am hearing from upper year students saying their friends got kicked out of calculus at the beginning of the year because they have retaken it.

Is it true that there is a possibility to get kicked out of the course? and also is it worth it to sacrifice scholarship for a course that may help me in the long term?

"SSMU, Just Admit It Already","The SSMU hierarchy couldnt deal with the fact that a Pakistani Muslim with a beard would become the new SSMU President. Now, I think it is important to note that I did not vote for Tariq or Courtney. It is clear to me that the SSMU hierarchy would look for blood. And they did. They discovered a few improprieties and stole Tariqs victory making the announcement on April 1st, which was in poor taste in itself and hand delivering the election to Courtney. Naturally, they investigated Tariq, however, all candidates likely engaged in improprieties especially if one looks hard enough. However, SSMU cast a blind eye towards the others instead making a federal case out of Tariq.

I feel like everything SSMU gets behind i.e. Farnan Gate is overcompensating for white guilt to such an extent that it becomes ridiculous. Yet, their actions and views reek so disingenuously. Frankly, most of these people are probably closet racists. Why is it that the SSMU execs and Ben Fung shook the hands of the victorious incoming exec at Gerts everyone except for Tariq who they left out?

And if my claim is too ridiculous, I think we can all agree that they are insanely hypocritical.

"The real denial of freedom of speech is happening over at the EUS, not with SSMU.","From the latest Pipeline

This is just a quick notice that as a result of the situation on Friday February 7th, from now on the Pipeline will be sent by Carlos Marin, the EUS President. 

If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to contact presidentmcgilleus.ca or equitymcgilleus.ca


So what Carlos is saying is that Luis Pombo had his right to send listservs taken away? If you ask me, this is a huge denial of freedom of speech, based on what was presumably a joke email to begin with. A forced apology is one thing, but literally taking away someones privilege to do their job as the VP Comm of the EUS is another thing all together.

Rant on Profs who wont record classes,"I cannot, for the life of me, understand why professors are so petrified of releasing lecture recordings when they Allow us to,

1. Review, clarify and confirm, as many times as we like, in the words of the prof, verbatim, the material of the course.
2. Watch lectures despite having to inevitably miss them Ive yet to have a prof who hasnt missed a day or cancelled a class, so were in our right to miss a class or two
3. Avoid having to stalk down profs before and after lectures to repeat that concept one more time, which is a waste of both of our time really, especially when your in a huge class with a prof who has incredibly small office hours relative to your course or better still office hours during another course which may or may not be recorded and therefore unskippable

despite the fact that

1. They dont require added effort on the profs part as they are automatic
2. Its not like theyre going to lose their job because of pirated lecture videos for obvious reasons like the necessity of enrolling into classes to get credits and to be examinated.
3. A drop in attendance shouldnt be a factor because
   1. It doesnt make inhibit your ability to teach
   2. It never changes drastically especially in large classes 
   3. Not being able to bloviate in front of a waning audience without taking a hit to your ego should not be a factor if whats causing it is making it easier for your students.

Bottom line, lecture recordings invaluable to students and require so little of the profs. I dont by any means try to imply that lecture recordings are a right, I just dont understand why a prof would deprive us from such a legitimate learning tool?



I dont entirely suppose profs require an explanation to disallow lecture recordings, but when they do offer one, its usually Students will stop coming, or Its my intellectual property and Im afraid of piracy. Given these explanations, I cant help but feel that theyre refusal is fueled by ego an ego which begins to infringe on the ability of their students to learn. If Im honest, when this happens to me, especially in a course Im nervous but enthusiastic for, I feel shortchanged. 

So, if there is another reason why profs dont release their lecture recordings that they dont like to say publicly Id like to know! Help me mitigate my ragefearanxiety into a mantra of rationalizations. I dont doubt some profs, on some level conscious or subconscious, fear that a recording may reveal that something taught was incorrect or held against them later.

In the end I respect the fact that it is their right. I just cant find a good reason for why they should exercise it but then again, nobody asked me.

How complicatedman power involved in designing complicated websites?,"Sorry I was responding to a delete post, I realize this is only relevant to a few of the CS people 



Ive got a related question. 

For the last year, parttime, Ive been working on starting my own business. If it works out and the science will work out, ive checked with faculty and the published background research it will revolutionize an industry worth 2 billion every year in the USA... and as it is entirely reliant on scientific innovation there is no competition whatsoever globally, none, zero, nothing.   

In the 14 year term I need 

1. A website capable of allowing people to upload photos and text information it can be google forms ugly its for internal use, correlate that information with database information, perform complex stats ideally in R which I can do myself, and spit back a nicely formatted professional report either immediately or within a few hours. 

2. A website that will allow people to search, using pull down menues and text boxes, a number of pages imagine the worlds shittiest version of a dating site where everyone only had 6 photos and a pdf on their page.  

3. A very nicely formated website, with private logons, which would display graphical representations of statistical information that would be unique to each person, ideally with some kind of figures that could change in real time to display different information to the user.

The opportunities Ill have just by attending this school will be far more advantageous than those I would have had access to if I had attended any other school in Canada, really.  However, I really do feel like the student actions this year will devalue my degree and actually hurt some employment opportunities I might come across.  I know that Ill never take a class offered by any of the professors who support the strike Is someone that incapable of logical thought competent enough to teach their area of expertise?  I dont think so, and I refuse to pay over 1000course to find out.  I also wont be hiring any current SSMU or AUS exec members in the future should I find myself in the position to do so again I left work to come back to school because they have done nothing to convince me that they wont waste my time as an employer.

Im assuming they know that the protesters do not hold the support of the majority of students, but the destructive actions of a few could really harm the opinion held of the entire group, because of the human tendency to categorize and classify groups of people.

What action can we take, as a group, to dissociate ourselves from the destructive activities and lack of discourse that our own representatives promote?  How can we show both the academic community and the region as a whole that we do not wish to be associated with the actions of these maniacs?

Basically, what do you guys think we can do to maintain the value of our degrees, in the face of rising resentment for students?  I thought of an open letter, but would that be visible enough to the entire community, beyond McGill?  What do you guys think?",1335448474,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/stjo6/your_thoughts/,9,yawnlikeyoumeanit,stjo6,4/26/2012 13:54,"['came', 'well', 'mcgill.', 'opportunities', 'ill', 'attending', 'school', 'far', 'advantageous', 'would', 'access', 'attended', 'school', 'canada', 'really.', 'however', 'really', 'feel', 'like', 'student', 'actions', 'year', 'devalue', 'degree', 'actually', 'hurt', 'employment', 'opportunities', 'might', 'come', 'across.', 'know', 'ill', 'never', 'take', 'class', 'offered', 'professors', 'support', 'strike', 'someone', 'incapable', 'logical', 'thought', 'competent', 'enough', 'teach', 'area', 'expertise?', 'dont', 'think', 'refuse', 'pay', 'course', 'find', 'out.', 'also', 'wont', 'hiring', 'current', 'ssmu', 'aus', 'exec', 'members', 'future', 'find', 'position', 'left', 'work', 'come', 'back', 'school', 'done', 'nothing', 'convince', 'wont', 'waste', 'time', 'employer.', 'people', 'outside', 'academic', 'community', 'quebec', 'wont', 'able', 'distinguish', 'students', 'support', 'strike', 'protests', 'students', 'condemn', 'them.', 'im', 'assuming', 'know', 'protesters', 'hold', 'support', 'majority', 'students', 'destructive', 'actions', 'could', 'really', 'harm', 'opinion', 'held', 'entire', 'group', 'human', 'tendency', 'categorize', 'classify', 'groups', 'people.', 'action', 'take', 'group', 'dissociate', 'destructive', 'activities', 'lack', 'discourse', 'representatives', 'promote?', 'show', 'academic', 'community', 'region', 'whole', 'wish', 'associated', 'actions', 'maniacs?', 'basically', 'guys', 'think', 'maintain', 'value', 'degrees', 'face', 'rising', 'resentment', 'students?', 'thought', 'open', 'letter', 'would', 'visible', 'enough', 'entire', 'community', 'beyond', 'mcgill?', 'guys', 'think?']",1,0,0,0
